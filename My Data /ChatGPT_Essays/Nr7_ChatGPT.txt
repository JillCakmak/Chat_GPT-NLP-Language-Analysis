Title: Rewriting the Life of an “Ultra-Radical”: Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and
Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli (1852)
Introduction:
In the mid-19th century, a wave of intellectual and social upheaval swept through America,
challenging conventional norms and redefining the landscape of thought. At the forefront of
this movement were figures like Margaret Fuller, an “ultra-radical” thinker, and her
contemporary, Ralph Waldo Emerson. This essay delves into the transformative period of
Fuller's life, the influence of Emerson on her intellectual journey, and the portrayal of her
legacy in the posthumously published "Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli" (1852).
I. The Radical Intellect of Margaret Fuller:
Margaret Fuller emerged as a leading intellectual force, challenging societal norms and
advocating for the rights of women in a male-dominated society. Her transcendentalist
beliefs, heavily influenced by the ideas of Emerson, propelled her into the realm of what
many considered "ultra-radical" thinking. Fuller's writings, such as "Woman in the
Nineteenth Century," not only questioned gender roles but also explored the
intersectionality of social issues, setting the stage for a profound reevaluation of societal
structures.
II. Emerson's Mentorship and Influence:
Ralph Waldo Emerson, often regarded as the intellectual father of transcendentalism, played
a pivotal role in shaping Fuller's philosophical outlook. The mentorship between Emerson
and Fuller was symbiotic, with each influencing the other's ideas. Emerson's emphasis on
individualism, self-reliance, and the divinity of nature resonated deeply with Fuller,
amplifying her commitment to social reform and intellectual exploration. Their intellectual
symbiosis challenged societal norms and expanded the boundaries of philosophical
discourse.
III. Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli (1852):
The posthumous publication of "Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli" in 1852, edited by
Emerson and James Freeman Clarke, serves as a complex lens through which Fuller's legacy
is refracted. This biographical work not only encapsulates her intellectual contributions but
also grapples with the challenges and controversies surrounding her personal life. The
memoirs, while providing insights into Fuller's radical intellect, also reflect the societal
struggle to reconcile with a woman who defied traditional roles.
IV. Rewriting Fuller's Narrative:
The act of writing and editing Fuller's memoirs was an attempt to redefine and control the
narrative of her life. Emerson, who was deeply connected to Fuller, sought to present her in
a way that aligned with the transcendentalist ideals they both championed. However, this
endeavor was not without its challenges, as societal norms and biases played a role in
shaping how Fuller was remembered. The memoirs, in their attempt to rewrite Fuller's
narrative, reveal the tension between preserving her intellectual legacy and conforming to
societal expectations.



Conclusion:
In the intertwining lives of Margaret Fuller and Ralph Waldo Emerson, we find a narrative of
intellectual growth, societal upheaval, and the challenges of rewriting a legacy. The
posthumous memoirs serve as both a tribute to Fuller's radical intellect and a reflection of
the societal struggles to come to terms with a woman who defied convention. As we
navigate the complexities of their relationship and the memoirs, we uncover not only the
radical spirit of Fuller but also the broader societal transformations that marked this pivotal
period in American history.
