Chapter 1: Introduction
On 10 January 1972, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a speech at
the Race Course Ground in Dhaka after his release from a Pakistani jail stating: ‘Now,
my Bangladesh is independent […] and the people of Bengal have been liberated. My
Bengal will remain free.’1 Rahman’s declamation culminated a two decade long
struggle for independence from Pakistan which encapsulated a complex and
multifaceted political history of Bangladesh. This narrative started with the formation
of Pakistan as two halves – East and West – that led to bilateral anxiety resulting in
separation. Between decolonisation and independence, the history of Bangladesh
unfolds multi-layered conflicts related to politics, economy, religion and culture.

This historical backdrop is the core of this thesis which investigates the architectural
production in which two distinct nationalisms played simultaneous roles – Islamic
nationalism and Bengali nationalism. It was in this context in which Pakistan emerged
as an Islamic nation overlooking the cultural significances of its Eastern counterpart
that led to Bengali nationalism in the same period. Here is an interdisciplinary research
that attempts to unravel the relationship between architecture and politics in a context
of ideological conflicts and economic discrepancies. This research contributes to the
fields of Bangladeshi and South Asian postcolonial architectural historiography and
political and cultural studies. It also provides a basis to study further architectural
production after the independence of Bangladesh. The thesis investigates architecture

the Father of the Nation. He served as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh between 1972 and 1975.

of mostly governmental and institutional buildings focussing on individual actors –
politicians and architects – in order to understand the context of development and
designs between 1947 and 1971 with a background of international funding, political
uncertainties and religious and cultural conundrums.

1.1 Between Formation and Representation
Throughout its existence, Bangladesh has been known by several names – the Bengal
Delta, Bengal, East Bengal and East Pakistan according to different periods. The first
three identities were a constant part of India and existed under a series of rulers from
different regions from the third century until the twentieth century, such as Buddhist
monks, Hindu Jains, Persian Sultans, Mughal Emperors and the British rulers (fig. 1).
The territory became East Pakistan as a part of the new nation of Pakistan,
segregating itself from India in 1947 (fig. 2).2 The creation of Pakistan was unique and
at the same time it was idiosyncratic for three reasons. Firstly, the country was founded
on religious nationalism which resulted in severe uncertainties such as the mass
migration of Hindu population in India and the Muslim population in Pakistan.
Secondly, Pakistan was given two discrete territories to govern as one state which
were separated from each other by thousands of miles of Indian region . West Pakistan
was larger and consisted of the Western regions of Punjab and Sind, Baluchistan,
Capital territories of Karachi and tribal areas on the border adjacent to Afghanistan
(fig. 1). In contrast, East Pakistan was densely populated consisting of the area of
modern-day Bangladesh. These two aspects – religious nationalism and geographical

Pakistan in 1955.

placement generate the third reason. After the partition, Pakistan inherited regions that
were mostly rural and focussed on raw-material productions. In contrast, India
acquired the central administrative states of the British colony such as New Delhi,
Mumbai and Kolkata which had civil bureaucracy, military services and ports.3
Therefore, India succeeded the old administrations of colonial power and Pakistan had
to establish itself from the scratch in terms of government formation, administrations,
armed forces, roads, railways and the urban planning of the cities.

The key point for mentioning these three reasons is to address why the formation of
Pakistan gradually antagonised its Eastern counterpart resulting in civil war. Did
architecture even play any role at all amidst this situation? Pakistan was faced with a
massive task of building the nation in which the ‘quest for an identity was both Islamic
and national.’4 Alongside forming governing bodies for the two provinces, urban
planning and the construction of public buildings became the utmost priority for
Pakistan’s development. This brought opportunities for locals to be trained as
architects and the country received attention from the West – especially the United
States of America who assisted by sending expert architects and engineers as well as
funded development schemes. Initially, the two halves of Pakistan imagined a similar
vision of building a unified Islamic nation, however, during the process, the two

Mass.: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2004), 11.

provinces were faced with internal politics that raised issues dealing with power,
language, culture and economy.

The main focus of this thesis consists of two themes – the political backdrop and the
architecture that was produced amidst the circumstances. The first conflict to arise
between the two wings of Pakistan was regarding the language issue in which then
Governor-General and Prime Minister of Pakistan respectively, Muhammad Ali Jinnah
and Liaquat Ali Khan repeatedly imposed that ‘Urdu should be the language of millions
of Muslims.’5 This was not acceptable for Bengalis as the majority of the population
(56%) spoke the Bangla language and were from East Pakistan. This led to protests
and strikes amongst Bengalis denouncing Urdu as the state language culminating in
Language Movement Day on 21 February 1952. Although the language issue was
resolved, nonetheless, the agitation continued and the East Pakistan’s politicians
formed the National Awami Party (NAP) – a leftist wing separating themselves from
the Muslim League.6 Led by Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani and other progressive
leaders and activists, NAP played an important role in the secessionist movement and
liberation of Bangladesh.7 Despite continuing criticism and domination of West
Pakistan over the East, the government attempted to keep the provinces together.
This was evident mostly during the military regime of President Ayub Khan between
1959 and 1969 in which he declared the constitution of provincial administrations and
bureaucratic bodies as well as colossal development projects in both wings of

Pakistan. Another reason Khan wanted to keep the peace between the provinces and
appease the East Pakistanis was in order to win their votes during elections.

Despite the continuing political agitation and economic discrepancies, East Pakistan
experienced rapid development both in governmental and institutional sectors. This
thesis examines selected buildings as case studies built between 1947 and 1971
arguing that architecture played an ideological and nationalist role that neutralised
dominant administrative and legislative mechanisms of the Pakistani Government.
Key actors in my research are the local and expatriate architects who were
commissioned to design and construct the public buildings. The study of the
architectural buildings will be examined through the philosophies and design
techniques of individual architects and how they perceived their client – the
Government of Pakistan (mainly Ayub Khan) during the political turbulences.

The architectural readings are loosely chronologically structured in order to
comprehend the subtle transformations within the built environment as well as to
compare the designs of the various architects. The thesis is thus organised according
to three themes – architecture that identified Bengali characteristics, architecture that
contributed to ‘tropical’ design and construction techniques and architecture that
expressed independence of the country. The first theme explores the architectural
transformation between the postcolonial Islamic style of the governmental and private
sectors following Muzharul Islam’s western influenced designs combined with Bengali
characteristics. Alongside featuring Islam’s transition both in his architectural career
and in his designs, this theme also explores a collaboration project undertaken by

6



Islam and Stanley Tigerman. The second theme investigates a larger body of
architects who primarily worked in East Pakistan during the 1960s. These architects
were part of broader developing schemes and international funding projects, namely
Constantinos A. Doxiadis, Daniel C. Dunham, Robert Boughey, Paul Rudolph and
Richard Vrooman. Their architectural endeavours will be examined focussing on sitespecific language such as climate consideration and how they perceived Bengal’s past
as an inspiration in their designs. The third and last theme provides a critical analysis
of the Capitol Complex of Bangladesh designed by Louis I. Kahn which was originally
conceived as the Second Capitol Complex of Pakistan. By demonstrating Kahn’s
perception of the region, design development and change of client, this study
represents the final transition of East Pakistan into its new identity of Bangladesh.

These architectural themes have been discussed by a range of scholars. Either
separate architectural projects by individual architects have been explored or studies
have focused on group architectural works during the Pakistani period of Bangladesh.8
However, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the architectural projects that
examined the buildings as nationalist products and how they were particularly
conceived in the context of East Pakistan.

This thesis addresses this gap in research by combining a historiographical analysis
of the formation of Pakistan and its geopolitics with detailed readings of architects and
architectural projects in order to develop an insightful and nuanced contextual

interpretation. It thus provides a new interpretative layer in which to value the
construction of buildings in East Pakistan during a period of political turmoil, both as
historical and architectural subjects. Detailed analysis of the case studies also allows
for broader architectural themes such as Modernism, Regionalism, and the Tropical
approach to be understood in new and diverse ways.

In this thesis, the relationship between architectural buildings and political settings is
often analysed either separately or by making parallel links. This will assist in
demonstrating the connection between the ambivalent nature of Pakistani politics and
the ambiguities that architects faced during their design development. However, with
detailed examination of the buildings, the projects achieve more relevance in the realm
of architecture and politics. I also attempt to understand the uncertainties between
architecture

and

politics

through

multiple

historiographical

narratives

from

multidisciplinary perspectives. The thesis contributes to postcolonial architectural
narratives and at times exposes contradictory interpretations. Nevertheless, it offers
an analysis that synthesises disciplines such as history, architecture, politics, religious
and cultural studies.

The thesis aims to provide a better understanding of the architectural development
and evolution of design alongside a comprehension of the critical geo-political context
of Pakistan between 1947 and 1971. The analyses are developed with a
methodological approach that considers multiple interpretations. Rather than seeking
to provide a direct answer for these buildings as nationalist products, both
inconsistencies as well as continuities will be explored.

8



1.2 Theoretical Framework
The research interest in this study does not seek to celebrate the architectural projects
built between 1947 and 1971. Instead, the thesis extends across and in between
diverse and polarised time periods interpreting these buildings as a search for
particularities of Bengali identity, new methods and techniques of design and hope for
liberation as enacted throughout the twenty-four years of being part of Pakistan. There
are two aspects working simultaneously in this research – architecture and politics –
both manifest multiple dimensions as the analysis proceeds.

Most of the buildings that have been selected as case studies were either initiated or
completed during the 1950s and 1960s. Architectural readings are informed by either
‘marginal’ or ‘other’ types of Modernism within a background study of the theoretical
analysis of building styles.9 The architecture of South Asia during the 1950s and 1960s
has been grouped as a product of Regionalism or as buildings of tropical approach
similar to the recognition of African development of the same era. Nevertheless, the
case for Regionalism loses its meaning when a building is studied with critical analysis
of its surrounding context and the psyche of the people for whom it is built. For this
reason, the case studies of this thesis are explored according to diverse interpretations
of architectural analysis and construct a framework to comprehend the relationship
between architecture and culture within a multidisciplinary matrix.

South Wales, 2013), 8.

Another aspect of political critique emerges with the meticulous study of nationalism
in this thesis. The focus period between 1947 and 1971 experienced multiple layers
of nationalism. The creation of Pakistan was solely based on religious nationalism.
The main reason for partition during the decline of colonial power was because the
Muslim majority demanded their own separate nation. However, under the umbrella of
Muslim consciousness, the people of East Pakistan were discriminated against,
criticised and imposed upon with the insistence that they should adopt their new
Islamic culture and deny their ethnic and traditional roots. Right after the formation of
Pakistan, language became a main concern between the two wings. Between 1947
and 1952, the conundrum of the Urdu-Bangla language initiated a new and segregated
ethos of Bengali nationalism. The continuity of political disagreement generated the
most crucial point of East and West Pakistani history which was the General Election
in 1970.10 The Bengali nationalist party, the Awami League won with a huge number
of votes and Pakistan’s Peoples Party (PPP) failed to win any governing seats in East
Pakistan. Subsequently, then Prime Minister Yahya Khan and the PPP denied the
Awami League’s majority win causing political unrest, military lockdown and genocide
that eventually led to the War of Independence. The war continued for nine months
and East Pakistan became an independent state of Bangladesh on 16 December
1971. In the last two years of being Pakistan, Bengali nationalism was transformed
into Bangladeshi nationalism – amalgamating traditional and cultural values with
sovereign and individual identity.

10 For a detailed history see, Zaheer, The Separation of East Pakistan: The Rise and Realization of
Bengali Muslim Nationalism; Lawrence Ziring, The Ayub Khan Era: Politics in Pakistan, 1958-1969
(Syracruse: Syracruse University Press, 1971); Jalal, The Struggle for Pakistan: A Muslim Homeland
and Global Politics.

10



These three layers of nationalism – Islamic, Bengali and Bangladeshi – work as a core
backdrop for the thesis to examine the architectural case studies. Furthermore,
alongside buildings, the changing nature of Pakistan’s political scene was also an
important aspect for architects to take in account during either their stay in or visit to
the country. The aim, therefore, is to study the architectural buildings alongside their
architect(s) within the complex political and cultural context. The research will thus be
acknowledged as a historical subject and will reveal its potential relevance in
postcolonial architectural discourse.

1.3 Methodology and Approach
The thesis is largely based on architectural readings in relation to drawing analysis,
construction techniques with the present-day conditions of the building being taken
into consideration. Core studies are supported by analysis of political historiography,
global relations and the architects’ academic and professional backgrounds. I present
a number of case studies of architectural buildings which have been broadly studied,
however, there are also some examples that have not received much attention in
existing scholarship. From conception to realisation, my main attempt is to offer a
comprehensive investigation of the buildings’ commission, design development,
construction methods and to highlight the literal and abstract meanings behind design
philosophies within the historical and cultural context. My research features an
overview of a range of materials collected from site visits, archives, old journals,
exhibitions, interviews, conceptual and existing literature, informal conversations and
unpublished documents.

11



During my research, I travelled to Bangladesh for a brief period for site visits of the
case studies in different cities and consulted a wide range of archives in Dhaka. My
site visits included trips to North Bengal (Pabna, Rajshahi, Bogra and Rangpur),
Barisal, Sylhet, Mymensingh, Comilla, Chittagong and Dhaka. The majority of the
selected case studies as well as the archives are situated in Dhaka; therefore, the
capital city offered me first-hand experience to investigate the architectural buildings
of Muzharul Islam, Daniel C. Dunham and Louis I. Kahn as well as the urban fabric of
the Old Town and other historical buildings built during the Mughal and British colonial
periods. Other cities provided individual buildings or university campuses to survey
with regard to architectural analysis, inspection of site and surroundings and user
experiences and photographs of current conditions were taken. Furthermore, the
North Bengal trip offered an extensive display of historical monuments and structures
that assisted me to understand the cultural and religious past of Bengal. These
heritage buildings included Jor Bangla Temple in Pabna, Puthia Temple, Govinda
Temple, Bagha Mosque, Pancha Ratna and Choto Sona Mosque in Rajshahi, Kherua
Mosque and Mahasthangarh in Bogra and Tahjat Palace in Rangpur.

I visited three archives in Dhaka – the Archives at the Department of Architecture of
Public Works Department (PWD), the Muzharul Islam Archive in Asia Pacific
University and the National Archives. Chief Architect Shameem Aminur Rahman has
mentioned that most of the archival documents in PWD are either lost, were burnt
during the Liberation War or disappeared when offices were moved or renovated.11
Nevertheless, I have collected architectural drawings by colonial architects working for

East Bengal PWD which provided me with insights about how an inclusion of mosque
was so important in any functional building in the region. Meanwhile the Muzharul
Islam Archive provided me with original architectural and working drawings for Islam’s
projects and I also acquired a lot of historical data and documents such as legislative
and parliamentary proceedings and economic plans for East and West Pakistan from
the National Archive. Alongside Bangladesh, I visited the British Library in London
which holds brief materials and documents on Bengal history in its Asia, Pacific and
Africa Collections. Finally, I visited the Constantinos and Emma Doxiadis Foundation
in Athens which provided me with primary resource materials such as architectural
drawings, notes and sketches. In addition, I have also obtained architectural drawings
and photographs remotely from The Paul Rudolph Institute for Modern Architecture in
New York, the Louis I. Kahn Collection in the University of Pennsylvania and Katherine
Dunham provided me with her father Daniel C. Dunham’s architectural materials,
notes and photographs. I also visited two exhibitions which focused on the architecture
of postcolonial Bangladesh at the Swiss Architecture Museum in Basel and the
Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York.12 Additionally, further findings have
materialised from substantial remote archival research of digital folders at the Ford
Foundation Archives and MoMA Archives.

As a result, my studies are informed by a broad range of primary source materials and
particularly by architectural drawings and sketches, brochures and catalogues,
unpublished notes and issues raised about East Pakistan, reviews of architectural
buildings in the region published in newspapers and articles, such as O. H.

12 Detailed experience and photographs are included in Chapter 3.

Koenigsberger article in the Architectural Review, Raymond Lifchez and James
Walden’s article in the Architectural Record, the seminar journal Regionalism in
Architecture aligned with the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, MARG and Mimar.13 I
have discovered new findings from various resources at times relevant yet
contradictory. For example, the political relationship between the USA and Pakistan
revealed the US’s intention to deploy ‘soft power’ on the new nation as it was closer
to Russia and this was actually one of the major reasons why Pakistan was receiving
ample funding from the organisations.14 Furthermore, the amount of information and
material I collected also necessitated selectivity, as I focussed on analysing selected
buildings with appropriate themes during the turmoil period of East Pakistan. However,
the historiography of Bengal is also intertwined with the later creation of East Pakistan,
so I referred to both cultural and ethnic values comparing these with the architectural
context. I, therefore, narrowed down relevant references from history in order to
provide a nuanced yet complex framework which negotiated political events alongside
architectural production.

My research has also benefitted from interviews conducted with key scholars and
architects who are actively contributing to Bangladeshi architectural practice and
scholarship. Additionally, I interviewed historians of Bangladesh who were able to offer
knowledge of East Pakistan’s political and civil war situation. This included key

Bangladeshi educators namely Muntassir Mamoon and Abdullah Abu Sayeed who
were active during the Liberation War in 1971. They provided a first-hand overview of
East Pakistan’s political situation, its condition before the genocide on the night of 25
March 1971 and the complex aftermath that stretched to war, all of which has informed
all of my chapters and provided relevant historical background information.
Architectural historian Adnan Morshed who is actively writing about architecture
related to Bangladesh provided a comprehensive insight into how to connect the
buildings to East Pakistan’s political context which helped me select the case studies
thematically. I was able to interview several scholars who worked closely with
Muzharul Islam namely, Zainab F. Ali, Fuad H. Mallick, Shamsul Wares, Kazi Khaleed
Ashraf, Shamail Inan, Nurur R. Khan and Ehsan Khan. They described their
experiences working with Islam including how he used to approach design and how
involved he was with history and architecture of Bangladesh. Whilst working with Islam
at Vastukalabid, Wares and Ashraf recalled the influences and inspiration he had
gained from Le Corbusier and Kahn. Furthermore, Nurur Khan, who recently finished
his Ph.D. on Muzharul Islam and the politics of Bangladesh at IUAV University of
Venice, provided valuable insights into the connection between Islam as an activist
and Islam as an architect. This symbioisis of being an activist and architect at the same
time played an important role in Islam’s design development. Bangladeshi scholars
have also reflected on how Islam was instrumental in inviting several American
architects namely Rudolph, Tigerman and Kahn to the country and have described
their architectural contributions. Dahlia Nausheen, Islam’s daughter has shared
personal anecdotes and facts about her father, revealing how he truly was as a person,
something which I would not be able to find in existing literature.

Farhan S. Karim, assistant professor at the University of Kansas has informed me on
Doxiadis’ architecture and how he developed his designs differently for East and West
Pakistan respectively. Finally, Katherine Dunham has kindly reviewed my documents
related to Daniel Dunham providing relevant information that has enriched my
research. Whilst Kahn’s National Assembly Building has been celebrated and
analysed by multiple scholars, the other case studies of my research remain largely
less examined. Therefore, in most cases, I approached my analysis with methods of
observation from the architectural drawings, sketches and notes, interviews and
archival documents mentioned above.

In order to establish a relationship between nationalism and architecture, I adopted
Benedict Anderson’s concept of ‘imagined communities’ in my research.15 This
approach assisted me with understanding the Bengal Muslim – Muslim Bengal
dilemma which was one of the major concerns of the people of East Pakistan during
the political turbulences. The Bengali’s search for identity remains a key theme
throughout my analysis which interrelates not only with architecture but also with
cultural, religious and economic contexts. In this way, the thesis offers a better
understanding of the motives behind the design and production of the featured
architecture as well as the governmental dominance over East Pakistan.

Finally, by analysing the architecture and the architects’ understanding of how to
implement their designs in the region, my research challenges the commonly

Revised ed. (London: Verso, 2016).

16



perceived notion of pre-independent Bangladeshi architecture as ‘Regional’ or
‘Tropical,’ which was prevalent during the 1980s and remains largely acceptable
today. Rather than agreeing with this perspective, I argue for a rational and contextual
aspect of Modern architecture. This approach is divided into three themes in my thesis
with each theme exploring one layer of architectural significance related to the analysis
of the design whilst creating a dialogue with the ongoing political and cultural context.
These themes will be elaborately discussed in the next section alongside a summary
of the chapters.

1.4 Outline of the Thesis
Chapter 1 introduces an essential background for the research in order to provide a
contextual setting in which the case studies will be analysed. Furthermore, it covers
the theoretical framework and demonstrates how I will address the gaps which have
not been examined in previous literature. Subsequent chapters outline conceptual and
thematical analyses in order to grasp a broader understanding of nationalism and
architecture in the postcolonial context of East Pakistan.

Chapter 2, Literature Review, examines the conceptual themes of the research –
nationalism, architectural transition and cultural context. The first theme outlines an
understanding of the concept of nationalism and interrelates its significance with
nation building and architecture. The second theme – architectural transition –
provides a study of different architectural styles which have been acknowledged for
the buildings of the 1950s and 1960s. Exploring various architectural resurgences in
a postcolonial context, this study attempts to comprehend the paradoxes of

17



architectural genealogies and how case studies are to be perceived in this thesis.
Finally, the third theme – cultural context – largely studies the dilemma of the Bengal
psyche of being either Muslim or Bengali. This theme compares the different
ideologies of East and West Pakistan and how nationalism was transformed from
being religious to regional.

The next three chapters 3, 4 and 5 are my main data chapters in which I examine
architectural case studies in different themes and tropes. Chapter 3, Architecture of
Bengali Identity, explores the architectural buildings which were built immediately after
the partition in 1947 in order to understand the transformations in design as the two
halves of Pakistan faced the language conflict. This chapter is divided into two tropes:
the first segment examines the public buildings designed by governmental and private
sectors in East Pakistan who were strictly following the religious requirements within
their design and construction; and the second segment extensively analyses the
architectural career and design of Muzharul Islam, who started his practice in the
simultaneous period offering a new insight into design ideas which reflected fresh
trajectories for Bengali’s search for a new identity which separated itself from that of
Pakistan.

Chapter 4, Architecture of the ‘Tropics’ outlines the architectural endeavours of
expatriate architects who were commissioned to work in East Pakistan. This chapter
comprehensively investigates the US-Pakistan political relationship during the Ayub
Regime and how foreign architects were assigned to the development schemes. By
exploring the architecture of Doxiadis, Dunham, Rudolph and Boughey, the first

18



section of this chapter provides various insights into the Western methods and
techniques of tropical design and how they perceived the heritage of Bengal’s past as
an influence in their designs. The second section overviews the importance of
architectural education in the region by analysing the establishment of the first
architectural department which was assigned to Vrooman.

Chapter 5, Architecture of Independence analyses the Capitol Complex of Bangladesh
designed by Kahn. Unlike other chapters, this chapter remains focussed on only one
building in order to understand not only Kahn’s design approach and philosophies but
also to understand important shifts in nation building through this legislative building.
A core aspect of analysing the National Assembly Building individually is to understand
how it was conceived as a secondary legislative infrastructure for Pakistan and how
on final completion it had become a national icon and main Capitol Complex for the
independent country of Bangladesh. This narrative reflects the motives of both
architect and client and how their political and philosophical perspectives finally
shaped the edifice.

Chapter 6, Conclusion summarises the analysis and synthesises the findings. The
concluding chapter offers an ultimate glimpse of political tensions between the two
halves of Pakistan and positions the interconnections between the politicians,
architects and architectural buildings. Finally, the chapter discusses further scope for
this research and how it might be extended or expanded for analysing the
contemporary architecture of Bangladesh.

Chapter 2: Literature Review
This chapter demonstrates the foreground and validation for undertaking this thesis.
This research is largely based on the study of both theoretical and existing literature.
The theoretical literature will be outlined in this chapter covering three major themes:
nationalism, architectural transition and religious-cultural context. These themes will
be explored in order to provide an overview of the theoretical framework for the spatial
study of selected case studies in the further chapters of this research.

2.1 Research Rationale
The interpretation of buildings is explained either by its spatial and visible existence or
through its social and cultural usage. In his article entitled ‘Architecture and Meaning,’
Robert Hershberger illustrated that the meaning of architecture can be demonstrated
according to two theories: ‘representational’ and ‘responsive.’16 The representational
theory focusses on the physical aspects of architecture such as form, material, colour,
shape etc. In contrast, the responsive theory has a more subjective focus that attempts
to address issues related to concepts, evaluation and perspective, which is also the
key point of this research. Responsive theory shapes the social and political facets of
architecture which also deals with subjects concerning ‘thoughts’ and ‘emotions.’17 By
exploring the aforementioned themes and tropes rather than only studying the
architectural significances, this thesis focusses on the study of social and cultural
aspects evolved with politics. The selected governmental and institutional buildings

examined in further chapters have been extensively explored in terms of their
architectural and constructional values. Nevertheless, the studies have seldom been
examined in the light of political history dealing with constant paradoxical concepts of
nationalism and identity crisis. This research will study the architectural production of
pre-independent Bangladesh (East Pakistan period, 1947-71) by analysing how
nationalism and social issues were intertwined with the political historiography.

The themes are explored in order to connect with the architectural reading of selected
case studies as well as to engage with existing literature in later chapters. The
theoretical analysis of the three themes is also studied, focussing on the culture and
context of East Bengal’s transformation into East Pakistan and later Bangladesh.
Firstly, the idea of nationalism is analysed in relation to Bangladeshi concepts of
nation-building through architecture. Secondly, in order to understand the architectural
transition of East Pakistan, the paradoxes of overlapping architectural styles between
the 1950s and 1960s such as Modern, Postmodern, Regional and Tropical will be
explored. And lastly, the third theme will focus on the study of culture and religion in
relation to the search for identity of Bengalis in a conflicting political environment.
Rather than a generic study, these social issues will be explored within the context of
political anxiety and its impact on the architectural historiography.

The themes explored in this chapter provide a foundation for the literature studies of
the further chapters. The existing literature study for the later chapters is divided into
three sections: firstly, the architectural transformation of colonial to postcolonial East
Pakistan and identifying the ‘search for identity’ through Bengali Modernism. From the

21



continuing works of governmental architectural office to the designs assigned to
Muzharul Islam, this analysis attempt to establish the significance of those public
buildings in relation to political and social aspects. Secondly, the architectural design
and construction process of foreign architects who exclusively brought the concept of
the ‘tropics’ in the region and how this dealt with the inspiration of past histories of
Bengal. Thirdly, a critical analysis of the National Assembly Building designed by Louis
I. Kahn which represents an exceptional transition from its change of client to an
altered nation’s identity.

By providing an overview of the theoretical framework, this chapter aims to subsume
a coherent interpretation of the radical concepts of nationalism, architectural transition
and culture. This chapter will attempt to provide a clear perspective by exploring crossdisciplinary scholarly writings in order to create an eloquent dialogue between the
various concepts and theories.

2.2 Nationalism, Nation Building and Architecture
The journey of achieving Bengali identity was a complicated process for East Pakistan.
Alongside the leftist political agenda, the fields of the fine arts, literature and theatre
acted as national catalysts for Bangladesh’s independence during the cold war.
Architecture also played an important role for national growth in expressing Bengal’s
rooted identity. In the beginning, however, the developing scheme was to build the
nation of Pakistan with an Eastern region which desired to express its rooted culture,
something that would soon problematise the concept of one united Islamic country.
Nonetheless, for both wings of Pakistan, nation-building was effective through

22



westernised modernisms that later transformed, as many critics claim, on the one
hand, either Regional or Tropical Architecture; or both Regional and Tropical
Architecture on the other. Modernism was transformed when architects designed
buildings which considered the local climate, implementing functional solutions suited
for tropical regions such as cross ventilation, material usage, flat roofs and so on.
Globally, this is not a new technique for architects, as they have altered and modified
designs in consideration of the site and context. For instance, many cities in Africa
were decolonised and nation building was promoted with built environments suited to
their climate and traditions. For the newly-built nations, constructing important public
buildings and infrastructures different from those built by their previous rulers was one
of the key points for nation building. Similar actions were witnessed when the Indian
subcontinent was divided and the chosen architecture for nation building was
successful to promote a nation’s new identity. However, for East Pakistan, nationalism
and architecture had altered meanings woven into the history of paradoxical search
for identity. These meanings were related to a region’s desire to achieve sovereignty
in order to harmoniously exist with both its religion and culture. Thus, the
transformation in nationalism and architecture which occurred during East Pakistan’s
journey to become Bangladesh will be examined through a critical survey of the
scholarly writings on nationalism, nation building and architecture.

2.2.1 Concepts of Nationalism and Nation Building
The idea of nationalism is a complex concept to define and interpret. Although from
the beginning of civilisation, collective groups of people are known to have connected
with their native regions and the traditions of their ancestors and to have established

23



types of territorial administration, nevertheless, it was not until the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries that nationalism originated as a concept of ‘sentimental activity’
in which the ‘feeling of anger aroused by the violation’ of certain norms and customs
were evoked by another dominant authority.18 The diverse concept of nationalism is
related to different perceptions of the emergence of various nationalist movements
ideally connected to cultural and political issues.19 The first powerful manifestations of
nationalism relate to the American and French Revolutions.20 The notion of
nationalism spread across the Western regions, such as the newly-built nations of
Latin America, to central Europe in the early nineteenth century and to Eastern Europe
in the mid-nineteenth century. It was not until the early twentieth century that the rise
of powerful nationalism and nationalist movements occurred throughout Asia and
Africa in the Eastern regions. These nationalist movements were actuated by the
‘thought’ and ‘emotion’ generating sentiment manifested by each nation to protect ‘its
unity, purity, autonomy and strength.’21 In all cases, the development of nationalism is
noticeable in the context of societies with rapid population and urban growth due, for
example, to the expansion of religious communities, monarch-related societies and
centralised political administration.22 Whilst these are common cases for the age of
nationalism in Europe, the emergence of nationalism in Asia and Africa was formed
through decolonisation and for postcolonial sovereign nations.

Nationalism was an active political choice throughout history, but it became a subject
of research during the eighteenth century onwards.23 Evaluating studies on nation and
nationalism, many critics provided ambiguous explanations of the chosen subject as
most of them agreed that it was a very complex idea to elucidate and comprehend.
Scholars of comprehensive analysis on nationalism struggled to devise an undeviating
hypothesis. Eric J. Hobsbawm argues, ‘Neither objective nor subjective definitions are
thus satisfactory, and both are misleading.’24 Benedict Anderson disputes, ‘Nation,
nationality, nationalism – all have proved notoriously difficult to define, let alone to
analyse.’25 Hugh Seton-Watson observes, ‘no scientific definition of the nation can be
devised; yet the phenomenon has existed and exists.’26 However, these scholars did
achieve an explanation for the notion of nationalism by connecting it with various
political and social aspects. Some of the best analyses are demonstrated in the early
writings of John Stuart Mill such as Considerations on Representative Government
(1861) and Ernest Renan’s famous lecture on ‘What is nation?’ (1882)27 The discourse
on nationalism soon became a passionate subject for analysis amongst Marxist
scholars who perceived it as a modern discourse on the international socialist
movement and connected it with powerful intellectuals such as Otto Bauer, Lenin,
Kautsky, Luxemburg, Stalin and so on.28 One of the most useful inquiries into

nationalism is perceived in the academic study of Carlton Hayes and Hans Kohn,
published after World War I.29 These two authors provided a modern sense of the
concept which later multiplied and advanced greatly in the following decades in the
scholarly writings of Karl Deutsch, John Breuilly, Benedict Anderson, Ernest Gellner,
Eric Hobsbawm and Anthony Smith.

In 1774, the first theoretical definition of nationalism was devised by the German
philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder in which he argued nationalism to be inherently
a ‘state of mind, a collective consciousness of identity generated, constituted and
constructed through memory, fantasy, whim and myth.’30 Similarly Hans Kohn argued
nationalism is,
A state of mind, permeating the large majority of a people, and
claiming to permeate all its members; it recognised the nation
state as the ideal form of political organisation and the nationality
as the source of all creative cultural energy and economic wellbeing. The supreme loyalty of man is therefore due to his
nationality, as his own life is supposedly rooted in and made
possible by welfare.31
In summary, nationalism ‘harbours emotional issues, cultural issues and political and
religious ideologies.’32 In order to understand nationalism, most of the literature
concerning it asks a common question: what is a nation? Hobsbawm suggests, nation

is ‘the product of particular, and inevitably localised or regional, historical
conjectures.’33 To establish this thought, nation(s) often sought common grounds such
as ‘language or ethnicity […] common territory, history or cultural traits.’34 Thus unity
of collective community produces the sense of nationalism and this alongside national
identity are interrelated with nation and these are logically inseparable from one
another. However, most scholars and theorists agree that the existence of nation is
assured by nationalism and not vice-versa.35

Nationalism represents ‘the philosophical and ideal aspects that bind together likeminded people with similar political and cultural groundings’ and national identity is the
characteristics ‘that shapes one’s national character.’36 The discussion of nationalism
becomes complicated for complex political settings resulting in a continuous discourse
amongst scholars, political leaders and the elites of the society.37 Ernest Gellner
defines nationalism as a ‘political principle which holds that the political and the
national unit should be congruent.’38 Eugene Kamenka also observes nationalism both
as a cultural and political product.39 Furthermore, Louis Synder interprets nationalism
as a ‘unity of culture’ involving political and historical aspects.40 Therefore, this thesis
will address nationalism both as a cultural and political element of a nation.

As a country, Bangladesh placed itself on the global map ‘as a product of a deeprooted cultural system.’41 Anthony D. Smith argues Afro-Asian nationalism to be
focussed on ‘independence, decolonisation and development.’42 Nation-building can
be defined as ‘the creation of a national community through political integration of its
members.’43 For the governments of the newly built countries, nation-building has
been not only favourable but also an achievable goal.

Thus, through the study of several governmental and institutional buildings, this thesis
attempts to explore the political aspects related to the culture and tradition that
generated the concept of nationalism. These buildings will be identified as products of
nation-building for Bangladesh rather than Pakistan. This can be represented by
exploring underlying issues related to ‘solidarity and unity evolving’ from the power of
nationalism.44 As Benedict Anderson disputes,
Nationalism has to be understood by aligning it, not with selfconsciously held political ideologies, but with the large cultural
systems that preceded it, out of which – as well as against which
– it came to being.45

In order to understand nationalism, scholars have examined the concept through
various types and components. Thomas Eriksen has suggested that three factors

contribute to the significance of nationalism: autonomy, unity and identity.46 Alongside
these components, two other aspects are pivotal to comprehending nationalism
namely, religion and language.47 Anderson suggests that cultural roots systems
associated with religious community and dynastic realm are the key elements of
nationalism.48 Kellas argues that ‘language is closely linked to ethnicity and
nationalism, and it is also a facet of human nature.’49 All these aspects were highly
influential in shaping the notion of Bangladeshi nationalism. The creation of East
Pakistan evolved from the idea of a Muslim territory in contrast to the concept of
Bangladesh which emerged ‘as an independent nation because of its people’s need
to protect and maintain their cultural inheritance.’50 Nationalism deals with ‘territoriality’
and one of the main sources of regional boundaries comes from cultural interference.

The emergence of cultural nationalism in the East has a very different narrative from
that of the West. As Smith defines, nationalism is ‘really only anticolonialism’ and it is
seen as ‘a response to foreign oppression.’51 In contrast, most of the nationalist
movements in the Eastern world occurred predominantly as a resistance to the
supreme class dominating the peasant class inhabitants. Through cultural nationalism,
the institutional framework of the nationalist movement was formed.52 The movements

emerged in East Pakistan in order to generate the notion of a new sovereign nation
and to also demonstrate the concept of cultural nationalism.

Benedict Anderson promoted the idea of cultural nationalism through a psychological
approach known as the theory of ‘imagined communities.’53 Anderson argues, ‘A
fundamental change was taking place in modes of apprehending the world, [which]
more than anything else, made it possible to “think” the nation.’54 Furthermore,
Anderson defines nation as ‘imagined political community’ which is sovereign and
suggests nationalism begins at the cultural roots of a homogenous society.55 His idea
became popular, and scholars merged his concept with the nationalism related to the
Eastern world. Many scholars of Bengali and Bangladeshi nationalism connected the
concept of ‘imagined communities’ in their writings in order to understand the cultural
and religious dilemma of the nation. This will be discussed in the next sections of this
chapter.

As much as nationalism can empower a nation through independence and to achieve
rights, there are also disadvantages to nationalism. Scholars argue that nationalism
can be the reason for separation. Marxist scholars view nationalism as fabricating
ideas in layers and being prone to extremise social issues such as religion or culture.
Whilst Smith and Anderson advocate in favour of nationalism by connecting it with the
continuity of the past and creating the idea of imagined community respectively,
conversely, Hutchison argues that nationalism disintegrates ethnic and traditional

values by provoking issues related to power.56 However, nationalism evokes
passionate discourse in multidimensional ways and can be regarded as a basic
element of human spirit in various disciplines of studies.

Anderson views nation as a modern construction evolved from the imagination and
closely related to the psychological association of the people. For example, in 1860,
after the unification of Italy and as a speaker at the first session of parliament, Massimo
d’Azeglio stated, ‘Italy is made, now we must make Italians’ – as only 2.5% of the
inhabitant spoke Italian.57 A similar notion can be found in the creation of Pakistan as
there would have been no collective force or meaning if there had not been a
geographical concentration of Muslim sentiments in the subcontinent.58 Smith states,
‘Pakistan, both as name and as national state, was quite clearly invented.’59 Jinnah
succeeded in creating Pakistan by segregating the majority of the Muslim populace
but not everyone spoke the proclaimed national language, Urdu. Thus, in order to
create Pakistanis, the situation was contradictory for the Bengal Muslims as they were
imposed to speak a language they did not recognise and to prioritise the religion by
completely dismissing their rooted tradition. Consequently, these conflicts generated
one of the core intentions for nationalism and nation-building. These conglomerated
theories have been relatable in relation to the debates over East Pakistan’s
historiography which went from first being separatist to later consequently being

secularist. This thesis discerns these concepts of nationalism as discussed above and
applies them in order to unravel the narrative of Bangladeshi nationalism.

2.2.2 Emergence of Bangladeshi Nationalism
The evolution of Bangladeshi nationalism is a long struggle encompassing the cultural
and religious consciousness of the people of Bengal to achieve their dignity and
freedom. Whilst Elie Kedourie argues that nationalism is an accidental invention of
European thinkers, these concepts nevertheless assisted other scholars to scrutinise
nationalism concentrating on different nations.60 Scholars of South Asia, especially
Bangladeshi academics, studied the nationalism of Bangladesh, alluding to previous
analyses on nationalism and seeking a connection between social and political
paradoxical concerns. However, seldom scholars attempt to connect the first and last
stages, focussing rather on the period of decline and loss. This section will evaluate
the critical writings related to Bengal and Bangladeshi nationalism in order to
understand the importance of ethnicity, culture and religion all of which led to the
construction of a complex political foreground for the nation.

The emergence of Bangladeshi nationalism is interrelated with several historical
nationalist movements that occurred during Bengal’s colonial and neo-colonial past.
These movements were prominently formed by economic and political deprivations.
In his PhD dissertation entitled ‘Changing Faces of Nationalism in Bangladesh,’
Muhammad Ghulam Kabir argues that in the case of Bangladesh, nationalism is

subject to vicissitude as it demonstrates different grounds of identity changes.61
Historical evidence suggests there to be mainly three phases of nationalism shaping
the concept of the ‘search for identity’ for the Bengal Muslims: Bengal partition in 1905,
Pakistan’s formation in 1947 and the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. However, in
her book entitled Bangladeshi Nationalism: History of Dialectics and Dimensions
(1992), Shireen Hasan Osmany argues, ‘Bangladeshi nationalism, like all nationalism,
is a product of the history of the people, their physical and cultural environment and
above all of their hopes and aspirations.’62 This dates back thousands of years to when
inhabitants of the delta were unified as a tribe known as ‘Vanga.’ The history of
Bangladeshi nationalism is intertwined with the changing authority of different rulers
and their cultural influences over the years. Therefore, a historical analysis of the
emergence of Bengal nationalism is necessary in order to understand the later
development of nationalist movements that took place during the colonial and
postcolonial periods. Although the core focus of this thesis is the nationalism during
the Pakistani period, nevertheless, an analysis of the formation of nationalism in
Bengal, East Bengal, East Pakistan and Bangladesh will provide a cogent theoretical
framework for further studies in relation to architecture.

Willem van Schendel has provided a meticulous history of Bengal from its being a
region of Hindu and Buddhist dominance, its transformation into Muslim majority, the
rise of separate Hindu and Muslim consciousness, Muslim nationalism and finally into
being Bangladesh.63 The Bengal people were first associated with the Indo-Aryan and

Mongol descendants who came to settle in the region. Combining their ethnicity and
traditions with Bengali culture, these groups of people were later known as Pundra,
Gaur, Harikela, Vanga, Rarh and Varendi. They formed and nurtured a common
identity and social practice which became the precursor of Bengal nationalism.64
However, this nationalism derived from homogeneity was transformed during the
Maurya dynasty in the third century B.C. as the region became dominated by Hindus
and Jains. Bengal nationalism transformed into Buddhist nationalism with the rise of
Sunga and Gupta dynasty (170-510 A.D).65 A unified Bengal nationalism flourished
again under the Buddhist rulers during the Pala dynasty in the eighth century B.C.
With the decline of the Palas in the thirteenth century, the legacy was carried by
Brahmin Hindus and was deep rooted with their ideology. With the advent of Muslim
ruler Ikhtiar Khilzi’s reign in the mid fourteenth century, Bengal was again unified and
nationalism was fused with Islamic enthusiasm. With the mass migration of Islamic
Sufis and saints and later the Mughal rule between the fifteenth and seventeenth
centuries Bengali ideologies became combined with Islamic thoughts, ideas and
philosophies derived from various cultures. During this period, the ethnic nationalism
of Bengal transformed to social nationalism and people from different religious and
cultural background co-existed with one another as a nation state.66

The aforementioned historical surveys demonstrate that Bengal nationalism has been
always dominated by one or multiple foreign forces. The authorities ruled over the
local inhabitants and transformed one nationalism to another. However, what

remained solely constant was the ethnicity, being Bengalis despite influences of
different culture and religion. Nonetheless, the external social influences on the ethnic
society impacted on the alteration of identity of the Bengalis for years.

During the British regime between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the identity
crisis of Bengalis was integrated with two dominant religions – Hinduism and Islam.
This became prominent when the Viceroy of British India (1899-1905), Lord Curzon
declared the Bengal Partition in 1905, which gave the administration opportunity to
control the vast area in a more organised way with its growing population. The partition
scheme divided the Hindu Bengalis of West Bengal from the Muslim Bengalis of East
Bengal. The new province of East Bengal consisted of the territory of present-day
Bangladesh and Assam (fig. 3). Although the partition was aimed at promoting
administrative efficiency, nevertheless, this was a planned strategy to control the antiBritish agitation of the Bengal Hindu intellectuals.67 Whilst the Bengal Hindus were
revitalising Bengali identity inspired by the European Enlightenment, the Bengal
Muslims ‘found themselves engaged in a futile search for their supposed
extraterritorial roots.’68 Thus Curzon was initially successful in creating a province of
Muslim majority as it was in favour of the nationalist group led by Nawab Khwaja
Salimullah who perceived the partition as an escape from Hindu domination; this then
generated a search for exclusive Islamic identity for the Bengal Muslims.69 Andrew
Sartori argues that for Bengal Muslims, this was a search for a shared identity

Bengal mostly by the nawabs, knights, zamindars and other feudal elements related to Islamic
society.

historically caught between the politics of two opposite sides of an Islamic identity with
its external territorial implications.70 However, by separating from themselves from
their hinterland of East Bengal, the Hindus of West Bengal perceived the partition as
an attempt to break the community away from their central capital city of Kolkata.
Whilst this incident was a unique opportunity for the Muslim elite to grow individually
as a province, nonetheless, under the leadership of Surendranath Banerjee, the
Hindus of West Bengal formed Bengali nationalism and held mammoth protests and
boycotted foreign clothes.71 With this vigorous and violent opposition from West
Bengal, the partition scheme was annulled, and Bengal was reunited in 1912.

These two occurrences – the Bengal partition of 1905 and the Bengal unification of
1912 as Kabir observes, ‘had profound consequences on the later political course of
Bengal’ largely determined the fate of East Bengalis in the next four decades.72 During
the Bengal partition, nationalism was divided into two parts –West Bengal continued
with their literary revolution against the British as a form of Bengal nationalism and
East Bengal initiated a nationalism with a Muslim consciousness that led to a separate
political development in later decades. Sartori criticises the identity development of
Bengal Muslim as ‘selfish,’ however, this identification of self-contradiction became
more complex when East Bengal entered into its new phase of becoming East
Pakistan.73

Muslims had always been the majority in population, and indeed, despite economic
and political disadvantages, they were able to form a separate political party consisting
of Muslims of India, calling themselves the ‘All India Muslim League’ in 1906 (fig. 4).
This political party later become the symbol of Muslims in British India and the Pakistan
movement was successfully led by them. The Muslim League, formed in Dhaka were
not able to achieve any success until they could secure the minimum of four per cent

of Muslim votes in the 1937 provincial assembly elections.74 Afterwards, the Pakistan
Resolution of 1940, initiated in Lahore acted as a catalyst in British India’s subsequent
political history. Under the leadership of the then prime minister of Bengal, A. K. Fazlul
Haq, the Muslim League fully supported the resolution and strengthened the demand
for an independent Muslim state formation. This time Bengal Muslims ‘were driven by
the powerful force of Muslim nationalism.’75 During the elections of 1946, the Bengal
Muslims fully advocated the creation of Pakistan which led to the historical partition of
India and Pakistan in 1947, declared by Lord Mountbatten (fig. 5).

With the formation of East and West Pakistan, as a united nation, the people of East
Bengal appeared to be strong Pakistani nationalists in the beginning. The nationalism
was rooted in religion which seemed to be their primary identity at that moment
notwithstanding it also being salient during the 1905 Bengal Partition. However, the
later political developments of united Pakistan not only created turbulences for East
Pakistan but also it cultivated secularist thoughts. Similarly, to when its first nationalism
emerged during 1905, East Pakistan again had a populace of Muslim majority and
also the foreign exchange earnings which were higher than those in West Pakistan.
However, despite disparities in economy and infrastructure, the central government
was dominated by the West Pakistanis.76 The conflict of the two wings intensified when
the then Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah attempted to impose Urdu as the
official language despite only a small number of West Pakistani elites speaking this
language. The Bengalis did not accept this and initiated the Bengali Language
Movement which started in 1948 and achieved its aim in 1952, when Bengalis were
succeeded in keeping their national language as Bangla.77 This was first time in
decades that Bengal Muslims now faced cultural discrimination from the community
they had supported in its growth. Thus, the Language Movement generated the
Bengali nationalist movement and during the provincial elections of 1954, the Muslim
League was in strong favour of autonomy and sovereign identity for Bangladesh. Kabir
argues, ‘In this process, the salience of religion as the primary focus of identity and a

76 Kabir, "Changing Faces of Nationalism in Bangladesh," 17.
77 In West Pakistan, majority of the people were speaking in Punjabi (57%), Sindhi (13%) and Pashto
(8%). Urdu was spoken by 7% of the population. In contrast, 99% population of East Pakistan were
speaking in Bangla language. Thus, Jinnah’s visit to the East Pakistan in 1948 and publicly
announcing for mandatory speaking of Urdu for Bengalis resulted into the historical Bengali Language
Movement in 1952. Later, in 1955, Bangla was declared second national language of the United
Pakistan. See, Kabir, "Changing Faces of Nationalism in Bangladesh," 17.

unifying factor declined and language as a unifying factor grew ever stronger.’78 The
conflict of Pakistani nationalism against Bengali Nationalism stretched another eleven
years during the regime of military dictator President Ayub Khan, as he developed
political schemes in order to gain support from the majority population of East
Pakistan. The Bengalis, both Muslims and remaining Hindus in East Pakistan, united
against the central government of Pakistan and gave rise to a new cultural nationalism
that ultimately resulted in the emergence of Bangladesh.79

This phase of nationalism replaced religious identity with cultural identity, however,
with the independence of 1971, Bangladesh was challenged by a new political and
cultural dimension. Shadowed for decades by West Bengal and West Pakistan,
Bangladesh as a sovereign nation was faced with the important question of ‘how to
give their nation a new and distinct identity.’80 The search for this new identity merged
the issues of ethnicity and religion and Bangladesh emerged as a modern nation coexisting with its neighbouring countries. After 1971, Bangladesh underwent a new
phase of nationalism generating an ‘intense desire’ to harmonise previous complex
factors such as merging structural components religious and culture.

2.2.3 Architecture in Shaping Bangladeshi Nationalism
Nationalism as explored in terms of nation, national identity and nation building gained
much attention in academic disciplines during the eighteenth century. However, it is

not until the present century that academic attention has been apparent in the study
of the links between postcolonial architecture and nationalism. This is not only in the
case of Bangladesh, but for many postcolonial countries, the architectural
historiography has been a matter of research in relation to nationalism and nation
building. Decolonisation initiated prominent changes to the demography of nations and
their politics which helped scholars to generate research in this matter. These studies
generate investigations on how does architecture – a building design or an urban
planning - can be a notion of nationalism that reshapes thought and emotions. What
is the role of nationalism in architecture and how does they relate to each other? Thus,
this section will survey critical writings on nationalism and architecture in order to
understand the connection between Bangladeshi architecture and its nationalist
historiography.

As Anderson’s ‘imagined community’ became prevalent, nationalism was not only
defined in terms of politics or territory but also in terms of representation. Public
structures can take many forms and can be represented as various kinds of symbols.
These symbols enhance the values and significance of a nation’s identity either from
detailed methods of design and construction or from the whole concept that shaped
the building. As Clifford Geertz states, ‘The images, metaphors and rhetorical turns
from which national ideologies are built are essentially devices, cultural devices
designed to render one or another aspect of the broad process of collective selfredefinition explicit, to cast […] hope into specific symbolic forms’ in which ‘they can

41



be described, developed, celebrated and used.’81 The perceptible symbols of
nationalism can take in many forms. For instance, Raymond Quek implies, allegorical
maps are ‘accurate instruments of measure national dominion.’82 Vale suggests that
the flag of a nation is carefully designed with icons related to the issues that created
the state and images on coins and currencies are associated either with the nation’s
leaders or are often depicted with native flora and fauna.83 On a contrary, Paul
Goldberger argues, ‘Architecture is the ultimate physical representation of a culture,
more so than even its flag.’84 Lang states architecture carries symbolic meaning about
a nation’s identity.85 However, not all works of architecture or urban design can be
assumed to be national symbols, rather they assist the city in building its
characteristics. Therefore, architecture can play an important role for nation building
as Karl Deutsch states,
Nation building […] suggests an architectural or mechanical
model. As a house can be built from timber, bricks and mortar,
in different pattern, quickly or slowly, through different
sequences of assembly, in partial independence from its setting,
and according to the choice, will, and power of its builders, so a
nation can be built according to different plans, from various
materials, rapidly or gradually, by different sequences of steps,
an impartial independence from its environment.86

Anthony King claims that the production of buildings represents nationalism when
there is a visible transformation in a nation’s socio-culture, politics and economics.87
In contrast, Mark Crinson argues that national identity conceals itself behind the
notions of tradition, regionalism and history and public buildings are declared
nationalist by virtue of a combination of their function and the intention behind their
construction.88 Disagreeing with Crinson, Vale disputes that some structures are
constructed as ‘purveyors of national identity’ as they are meant to be built as a symbol
of the nation-state.89 Goldberger points out the paradoxical definition of architecture
as something more or less than art.90 Choudhury denotes, ‘architecture and
monuments very often [transcend their] artistic purpose.’91 Conway and Roenisch
perhaps balance the argument of Goldberger and Choudhury by stating, ‘architecture
is not only about the material environment, but it is a symbolic expression of
aspirations, hopes for the future and beliefs.’92 Similarly, Roth states that architecture
demonstrates symbolic representation alongside providing shelter.93 Evaluating the
discourses of the scholars, it is clear that architecture offers a complex relationship to
the nation. Nationalism and architecture are often validated through decolonisation;

however, this relationship can be comprehended if the traditional values and economy
of a nation are considered as well.

The aforementioned concepts are popular amongst the postcolonial nations in which
resulting architecture or urban planning seldom resemble a true national identity.
Rather the identity of a nation is expressed through adaptation of modern ideas such
as modification for the tropical context by using local materials and economic-friendly
arrangements. Vale disputes, ‘Architecture and planning are often used as tools for
promoting something called national identity, but many dimensions of this
phenomenon remain unarticulated.’94 Reflecting on the designs of public structures in
East Pakistan, there are multiple references related to Bengali identity in contrast to
the West Pakistani public structures which portray strong Islamic resemblances.
Similarities in both regions’ architecture were largely associated with modernism which
is detached from cultural and social symbolism. Thus, to assess the public buildings
of East Pakistan, cultural and religious forces must be taken into account as ethnicity
shaped nationalism rather than enforced identity of a non-native territory. These
critical circumstances of East Pakistan can be comprehended by surveying the
research of other countries’ architecture with similar historical past in tandem with
recent scholarship of Bangladeshi writers.

Several publications have been useful for the thesis in order to understand the
complex past and political context of other countries and how the architecture
contributed in shaping the nation during crucial circumstances. The literatures are

mainly focussed on African countries or any other nations who had historical past of
decolonisation and who revived themselves from the cultural imperialism. Edited by
Raymond Quek, Darren Deane and Sarah Butler, the book entitled Nationalism and
Architecture (2012) demonstrate a well-structured connection between nationalism
and architecture by investigating modernism from various sphere through a range of
essays written by expert scholars.95 Quek introduces nationalist architecture as a
paradoxical challenge and throughout the book, all scholars examine this complex
concept with various global case studies.96 In order to promote diplomatic relations
between Israel and African nations, Ayala Levin examines Arieh Sharon’s Ife
University Campus (1962-1976) in West-Nigeria.97 Mark Crinson studies the concept
of national identity by analysing the European transformation into the International
Style.98 Alexander Tzonis investigates local architectural traditions as a means of
nationalist act within the global phenomenon of modernism.99 Other chapters consist
of case studies on Mumford and Jewish architecture, how Irish immigrant identity
impacted on post-war church architecture, Louis Kahn’s unbuilt public institutions in
America and Alvar Aalto’s works in Finland. Overall, the book manifests a rich
illustration of nationalism and architecture by investigating multidimensional
transformation of built forms and their context.

In his book Modern Architecture and the End of Empire (2003), Mark Crinson analyses
Modern architecture of selected nations (e.g. India, Iran, Ghana, Hong Kong etc)
‘refracted through the prism of British imperialism’ and the aftermath of
decolonisation.100 Crinson studies the economic dominance and cultural power in
order to understand the new hegemony of different countries between 1950s and
1960s through the critical theories of modernism. Ayala Levin explores architectural
adaptations against British colonial models and the relationship of Israel and Africa
between 1958 and 1973 through the buildings, complexes and urban plannings of
Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Ethiopia in her very recent publication entitled Architecture
and Development : Israeli Construction in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Settler Colonial
Imagination, 1958-1973 (2022).101 Another recent publication entitled Architecture in
Global Socialism (2020) by Łukasz Stanek demonstrates the vibrant collaboration of
architectural and construction companies from socialist Eastern Europe in order to
introduce Modern Architecture to the developing countries of West Africa and the
Middle East during the Cold War. Stanek explores how the local authorities and
expatriate architects brought Soviet prefabrication systems, planning methods of
Hungary and Poland, standard design methods and constructional materials of
Romania and East German to the cities of Accra, Lagos, Baghdad, Abu Dhabi and
Kuwait City.102 Stanek investigates how the socialist development scheme adapted to
the tropical climate and initiated a contextual architectural solution in these developing
cities.

Scholars have also conducted research on nationalism and Modern architecture
focussing on one nation. Sibel Bozdogan’s Modernism and Nation Building (2001)
highlights the historical parallels and spatial expressions of the early Republic period
in Turkey during the 1930s.103 By exploring the shifts that occurred between the
Ottoman revivalist movement up until the 1930s nationalist style of architecture,
Bozdogan demonstrates how the historical context can collectively summarise the
aspirations of early republican, Turkish architectural culture. In the book, Architecture
and Nationalism in Sri Lanka: the Trouser under the Cloth (2013), Anoma Pieris
studies the twentieth century Sri Lankan domestic space, architecture and material
culture during the decolonisation that witnessed significant political changes leaving
‘an indelible cultural imprint and bitter residue.’104 Hilton Judin investigates the
relationship between architecture and apartheid ideology through the buildings in
Pretoria during the 1960s in her recently published book Architecture, State
Modernism and Cultural Nationalism in the Apartheid Capital (2021).105 Judin’s
analysis focusses on what role architecture played within the conflicting cultural and
political demands. Judin examines these issues through the study of cultural
nationalism and the development of buildings constructed after the National Party
came to power in 1948. Another publication entitled Architecture and Politics in Nigeria
(2016) explores architectural endeavours of western architects, namely, Thomas
Todd, Kenzo Tange, Doxiadis and Albert Speer in Nigeria between 1967 and 2016.

Throughout the book, Nnamdi Elleh investigates whether the architecture and urban
designs of the aforementioned architects could provide ‘centre of unity to prevent the
country from disintegrating’ and if the 1970s masterplan of Abuja, which was inspired
from the late Enlightenment era, could represent a ‘culture of social justice’ in order to
save the country from future political corruption and military coups.106 This
contemporary research studies reveals some parallels with the study of this thesis
which analyse the architecture during the emerging nationalist movements of East
Pakistan.

Comprehension of the emergence of Bangladeshi nationalism has been analysed in
the previous section which focusses on the ethno-religion conundrum of the Bengalis.
In later decades, critics have attempted to connect the concept of Bangladeshi
nationalism to multidisciplinary subjects such as Kazi Nazrul Islam’s poetry, Hamidur
Rahman’s sculpture and Zainul Abedin’s paintings. However, this was seldom related
to architecture until recently, when several Bangladeshi scholars have attempted to
comprehend the architecture of pre-independent Bangladesh as a product of
nationalism. To keep the theoretical review focussed, I will here discuss literatures
only relevant to the segment. Further studies in relation to architecture of Bangladesh
will be reviewed elaborately in Chapter 3.

Most persuasive research of Bangladeshi pre-independence architecture in relation to
nationalism has been conducted by the director-general of the Bengal Institute namely

Kazi Khaleed Ashraf. In his doctoral dissertation ‘The Hermit’s Hut: A Study in
Asceticism and Architecture,’ Ashraf developed a unique cultural voice that formed a
theoretical background for his future writings connecting architecture with Bengali
culture and identity.107 From 1992 till the present day, Ashraf frames many
architectural buildings of Bengal, East Pakistan and Bangladesh and has developed
research in relation to the context, politics and culture through his many books and
articles.108 Ashraf was a member of Chetana (awakening) – a research study group
established in 1981 initiated by Muzharul Islam and his students. In order to document
the architecture of Bangladesh, Chetana published a book entitled Pundranagar to
Sher-E-Bangla Nagar in 1997.109 Ashraf penned the introduction of the catalogue
entitled ‘Wind, Water and Clay: The Architecture of Bangladesh’ in which he
emphasised the architectural traditions adapted from different rulers in response to
the geo-cultural settings of Bengal Delta.110 This study was advanced in his later
publication with James Belluardo entitled Reincarnations and Independence: The
Modern Architecture of South Asia (1998), in which Ashraf examines Muzharul Islam’s
architectural building as a production of nation building that echoes Bengali traditions
and cultures.111 Alongside these publications, Ashraf’s other articles assist this thesis

and its structure in further chapters which deal with understanding the concept of
nationalism in shaping the architecture of pre-independent Bangladesh.

Another article written by Bayezid Ismail Choudhury and Peter Armstrong
demonstrates a direct notion of nationalism and the architecture of Bangladesh from
different periods. In their article entitled ‘Monument and Architecture in Shaping
Bangladeshi National Identity,’ the authors attempt to understand the development of
Bangladeshi identity by analysing five dimensions asserted by Montserrat Guibernau
in his book The Identity of Nations (2007).

Guibernau describes nation as a community ‘sharing a common culture, attached to a
clearly demarcated territory, having a common past and a common project for the
future whil[st] claiming the right to self-determination.’112 According to the statement,
the five dimensions are psychological, cultural, historical, territorial and political.113 In
relation to Bangladeshi architecture, Choudhury and Armstrong have interpreted
Guibernau’s hypothesis with independence as psychological, language as cultural,
religion as historical, the landscape of Bengal delta as territorial and legislature as
political. Choudhury and Armstrong relate these elements of national identity to built
forms such as the National Martyrs’ Memorial representing independence, Shaheed
Minar (National Monument) portraying as language, Bengal Sultanate architecture
(e.g., mosques) denoting religion, Bengal rural huts depicting landscape and the
National Capitol Complex as a symbol of legislature (fig. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Connecting

with Guibernau’s five elements of national identity by exemplifying built forms as
symbolic expressions, Choudhury and Armstrong attempt to comprehend the
multidimensional identities seized within the complex definition of Bengali or
Bangladeshi ethnicity – Muslim Bengali or Bengali Muslim.114

The discourse of Bangladeshi nationalism and architecture has multiple layers and is
juxtaposed with different narratives. The theories discussed in this section will allow
this thesis to develop further critical analysis focussing on Modern architecture and
Bengali culture and traditions.

2.3 Critical Resurgence of Modern Architecture in Postcolonial
Context
Architectural ventures in postcolonial underdeveloped countries during the 1960s are
acknowledged in several formal terminologies that sometimes confound architectural
timelines. In the West, this was the period in which Postmodernism was largely
exercised, whereas the East was only just beginning to adopt and get acquainted with
modern design methods and construction technologies. Pakistan’s architecture also
belongs to the latter category. Indeed, architecture in the postcolonial countries was
never directly considered as being ‘Modern Architecture’, rather it was categorised
under various architectural styles branched with modernism, namely ‘Regional
architecture,’ ‘Tropical modernism,’ ‘Tropical architecture’ and so on. Therefore,
before diving into the investigations it is necessary to explore what architectural style
East Pakistan was adopting as a means of Muslim nationalism on the one hand and
secularist Bangladeshi nationalism on the other. Hence, within the discussions in
relation to architecture and nationalism, terms such as ‘imperialism’, ‘decolonisation’,
‘neo-colonialism’, ‘postcolonial’ will be carefully merged or contrasted with terms such
as, ‘modernism’, ‘postmodernism’, ‘regionalism’, ‘tropicalism’, ‘internationalism’ or
‘universalism.’ Consequently, analysis in this segment will outline theories and

53



examples related to these terms as an expression of complex and unresolved issues
rather than merely polarised ones.

2.3.1 Modern Architecture
It can be argued that the origins of Modernism lie somewhere within the Renaissance
whilst later the nation-state became the engine of modernity along with
industrialisation and mass production. Modernism emerged as a diverse and an
accessible tool for postcolonial countries in the 1950s and 1960s. In fact, Modern
Architecture was a transference from the colonial infrastructure, as Prakash, Casciato
and Coslett argue, and was the transfer ‘in the name of science and technology’ by
global agencies such as United Nations during 1950s and 1960s.115 Nevertheless,
capitalism and socialism both brought divergent ideas into modern construction and
postcolonial nations chose whichever suited them and developed their own ‘hybridised
and particularised conceptions of modernism.’116 This applies to nations, architects,
architectural organisations and other related institutions.

In a study of Modernism, Ananya Roy has defined it as a ‘dualistic narrative’ from
tradition, arguing that some forms of modernism outline progressive changes in an
aim to make it a world culture.117 Marshall Berman has described how the ‘modernism
of underdevelopment is forced to build on fantasies and dreams of modernity, to

nourish itself on an intimacy and a struggle with mirages and ghosts […] a desperate
incandescence.’118 However, Roy argues that this Faustian model of modernisation
and its aligned notions of authenticity with traditions are marked by an ambivalent but
‘desirous mimicry.’119 If the relationship between imperialism and modernism is
complex, then the same can be also said of the relationship between modernism and
tradition.120 Crinson argues that Modernism ‘sought to preserve tradition, setting the
distinct form of modernity apart from a distilled and sealed past.’121 The relevance here
within colonial contexts is where local and national cultures are often regarded as
‘traditional’ and the rejection of colonial architecture can be seen as ‘a reclamation of
indigenous culture.’122 However, Crinson argues that rejecting colonialism in order to
achieve modernity is an unnecessary connection demonstrated by the anticolonialists. Therefore, from the perspectives of scholars, it can be perceived that
modernism and tradition are not distinct or immutable, but they are more plural,
contested and political.

Modernism in architecture can be solely focussed upon its use of new technologies or
materials, such as reinforced concrete, glass, steel or particular styles of forms and
rhetoric. Above all, it can be understood through its spatial form and function.

Koohlas, and [Jacques] Herzog and [Pierre] de Meuron today, it
is the historical increase in the urban population as opposed to
the rural, one of the key social logics of capitalist modernity, and
spatial conditions of this historically new metropolitan life, which
is always the implicit subject of Modern Architecture, and in
relation to which it must irresistibly articulate itself. Modernism
is, in part, the question of what such a life might mean, and of
what forms it can and should take.123
Similarly, Curtis argues the Modern Movement to be a revolution in social purpose as
well as in architecture which tried to reconcile industry, society and projected
prototypes for mass housing development and urban planning.124 However, in a
similar vein to Roy’s ‘desirous mimicry,’ Curtis observes that although the visual sense
of Modern Architecture was imitated, it nevertheless gave direction to new
constructions and functional disciplines.125 It surely has historical reminiscence;
however, it implies the vision of human betterment as well as machine culture.126

The conceptual determination of Modernism within nation building is a ‘rerepresentation’ of ‘universality’ which is a direct result of colonial domination.127
Crinson argues that the advocates of Modernism were anti-imperialist because ‘their
architecture broke out of the convention-bound, authoritarian, national or Eurocentric
hierarchies’ by which other forms of architecture were compromised.128 Modernism as
a cultural form with translational specification can evolve into a problematic

nationalism, as Osborne disputes, for the problem is not how to represent the notion
of Modernism but rather how the concept of ‘modern’ can help the national culture
produce for itself a ‘cultural-ideological effect of various forms of state power.’129 This
notion alters the concept of Modernism in East Pakistan’s context upon its association
with a radically extended range of forms of cultural experience of ‘temporal difference
or non-synchronicity.’130 Thus, if the question arises as to what is actually implied by
Modernism, it can be defined as Osborne describes:
[Modernism] is in the increasingly complex exchange between
West and non-West relations [that are] currently being radically
transformed - that the full scope of modernism as its term of
translation manifests itself, as the name for the temporal form
through which the political contest between competing future
continues to be played out.131
The regional and traditional approaches to Modern Architecture represent the image
of modernity which functioned through foreign economic control, decolonised political
domination and of course the involvement of architects both native and foreign. To
understand these world economic forces and their effects on buildings, Anthony King
questions the framework in order to grasp the technological, institutional, economic,
social and cultural consequences of these developments:
How are we to understand this process of trans-nationalisation
in this process of the transformation of space and form? What
difference, if any, will it make to people’s social, political or
cultural consciousness? What kind of symbolic investment are
they to make in these new environments, what meanings will

they have and how will they mobilise these meanings for their
own social and political purposes? More significantly, what are
the prisms through which we should try and understand cultural
resistance to these developments and the differences which are
evident from one place to another? How relevant are the
categories, for this purpose, of nation, locality, region, religion,
class, gender, economy?132
To answer these questions, in relation to these elements, it can be said that Modern
Architecture offers a complex relationship to the nation. Firstly, architecture defines
the built forms in which colonialism is enacted yet superseded. Secondly, architecture
enables the redefinition and representation of beliefs and values, but it can only
succeed with the response of communities. And finally, financial, material and
intellectual production of architecture is integral to the economy. Therefore, Modern
Architecture can be summarised as being a result of social production and nationbuilding.

2.3.2 Postmodern Architecture
In order to understand the architectural prominence of East Pakistan, it is necessary
to review the aspects of Postmodernism which can accordingly reveal diverse
dimensions in the periphery of this thesis’ focus. For example, global politics within
socialism and capitalism; and a later combined discussion of Regional and Tropical
architecture. Postmodern Architecture has been largely examined by American
theorist and architectural historian Charles Jencks. Jencks has analysed
Postmodernism within the diverse transitions of global civilisation and mixed cultures,

132 King, "Architecture, Capital and Globalization of Culture," 401.

58



and within the ideology of economic growth and rationalism. In his numerous
publications of books and articles, Jencks has scrutinised Postmodernism combining
the theories of Regionalism and Critical modernism and connected with national
culture and inter-communication.133 Jencks argues that Postmodernism is not antiModernism, nor it is the rejection of traditionalism. Rather, it rejects the arguments with
‘which universal rights are often imposed by an elite on a subservient minority.’134

Modernism, perhaps, is the first ideological response to social crisis and formulated
new roles within itself, such as for religion.135 Jencks has coined the hybrid term
‘Socitalism’ which comes from fusing socialism and capitalism together in order to
understand the emerging realities in the new economy and industries.136 Cultural
postmodernism was an era when the global economy doubled in size which made the
rich richer and generated poverty. In the 1960s, this becomes the only pragmatic
paradigm of growth in politics and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
(IMF) set out on a mission for global modernisation which focused on the shift of
transitional culture into global politics. Anthony Smith argues that this focus definitively
pointed to nation-state and cultural imperialism for all of these fundamental elements
could be directed to ‘national culture’ which derived from ethnic communities.137
Therefore, the hybrid culture of assimilative modernisation came from various

2007); Charles Jencks, What Is Postmodernism?, Third, Revised and Enlarged ed. (London:

locations such as the United States and Europe and became a part of individual
nations.

Both Smith and Jencks assert that the evidence for diagnosing Postmodernism can
be found in the period of the Second World War. Jencks notes, ‘The death camps of
Nazis mass produced six million dead. Each number becomes the foundation stone
for the death of an ideology and the birth of a Postmodernism; or perhaps, as with
Israel, the emergence of a new nation-state.’138 Accordingly, it can be said that the era
of the 1960s was the birth of Postmodernism considering the critical alternatives and
socio-cultural explanations. Thus, capitalist competition in the postmodern era led to
a conversion to the idea of nationalism.139 Jencks views Postmodernism as ‘a
slackening of modernism into eclecticism’ and calls it ‘double-coding.’140 He divides
Postmodernism into two kinds of narratives exemplifying the period after the tragedy
of the Holocaust as one of underlying ‘social cohesion, progress, belief in religious
doctrine, Enlightenment’ known as ‘metanarratives’ on the one hand, and communist
countries where industrialisation was merging with traditional production as local
‘micro-narratives’ on the other.141 In order to place Postmodernism in between
modernism and traditionalism, Jencks observes that Postmodernism ‘finds itself
caricatured on one extreme side or the other, when its intention is to be pluralist and
cut cross the anonymities.’142 Whilst modernity relates to universalism, postmodernity
connects with the ‘agenda of multiculturism and the right of minorities.’143 Jencks

observes that the gradual death of modernism over time was due to the rise of
Postmodernism and reminisces using the quote of the architectural historian John
Summerson that ‘…this putative death was the most creative idea of Postmodernism,
because it liberated everyone from the false notion that the modern was the eternal
present and therefore always with us, not the historical construct that it is.’144

In contrast to the theories of Postmodern Architecture, Frampton argues that the
International Style in architecture had spread throughout the world by the time of the
Second World War.145 Frampton argues that although the International Style was
homogenous, nevertheless, it responded well to different climates and cultures.
Comparing the Neo-classical architecture of the later eighteenth century, Frampton
further argues that the International Style never became universal, rather it was
intended to have a universal approach in its techniques and ‘hypothetical flexibility’ in
demonstrating designs yet facilitating local or modern materials and fabrication.146

Both Postmodern Architecture and the International Style manifest architectural
representations ‘in-between’ Modern Architecture. Architectural theorist Elizabeth
Grosz notes, ‘the space of the in-between is […] a space without boundaries of its
own, which takes on and receives […] its form, from outside […] This form is the
outside of the identity […] of multiple others, whose relations of positivity define, by
default, the space that is constituted as in-between.’147 In his article entitled, ‘Tradition

and Modernity: The Feasibility of Regional Architecture in Post-Modern Society,’
Juhani Pallasmaa explores the ‘in-between’ state of Modern and Postmodern
Architecture. Pallasmaa states,
Architecture is not an expression of knowledge and certainty, but
of existence and faith and a perpetual search for reconciliation.
An architecture style is defined, both on individual and collective
levels, by a combination of certain mental orientations.148
In the exploration of the architectural style of East Pakistan, can it therefore be called
another Modern Movement for the East? Or is it the climate responsive architecture
acknowledged as Regional or Tropical? In this, rather than coming to a direct
conclusion, Pallasmaa’s analysis of Modernism in phases can be useful. For instance,
Pallasmaa explores Modern Architecture as ‘First’ and ‘Second’ Modernism. On the
one hand, First Modernism is ‘utopian, purist and demagogic’ whilst on the other
Second Modernism is a ‘realistic view of culture unblinded by illusions.’149 In terms of
style, the First Modernism aimed at perpetual innovation and weightless movement,
whereas the Second consciously borrowed from previous styles and expressed
stability and a sense of materiality.150 Therefore, according to Pallasmaa,
The Third World, the energy crisis, the university revolution, the
development of mass-communication and data processing are
all part of the mosaic of change as well as the whole Postmodern
debate. But also, an awareness of the dangers implied by the
technical

achievements of Western democracy lie behind the Second
Modernity.151
It is not possible to separate the First and Second Modernisms; it is basically a series
of transformations. These transformations are integrated phases of Modernism, such
as Expressionist, Organic and Regionalist that existed within the movement.152
Therefore, the architecture of East Pakistan as well as for other postcolonial countries,
can be placed in between the Modern and Postmodern which can also be referred to
using Pallasmaa’s term, as the Second Modernism.

2.3.3 Regional and Tropical Architecture
Regional architecture and Tropical architecture have been topics of scholarly interest
particularly from the postcolonial perspective. Numerous architectural historians and
theorists have provided a considerable number of late nineteenth and early to midtwentieth century buildings throughout the world as examples in order to resolve the
concept of Regional and Tropical architecture. It is important to notice here, that
theorists in some cases have divided their studies in order to establish these two
architectural approaches whilst in other investigations, they overlap one another. In
this segment, Regional and Tropical Architecture will be explored through theories and
examples in order to understand the different layers of their origins and how these
phrases intertwine with the idea of Pallasmaa’s Second Modernism.

Society," 138.
152 The momentum of the first modernism began to run out in the 1950s and the emerging change
was revealed in the discussions of CIAM. Louis Kahn an Aldo van Eyck appeared as the most
outspoken heralds of change. Kahn brought back the archive and metaphysical dimensions and van
Eyck introduced an anthropological and structuralist view. See, Pallasmaa, "Tradition and Modernity:
The Feasibility of Regional Architecture in Post-Modern Society," 138.

Regional Architecture
The idea of Regionalism was previously addressed in France during the 1960s through
an imitation or pastiche of local and native forms of colonised countries. Curtis
observes that the first-generation buildings constructed in the style of Regional
Architecture are evident in Jean Prouvé’s Maison de Peuple (1937-39) in Clichy near
Paris (fig. 11) and Le Corbusier’s project for an Agricultural Estate (1942) near
Cherchell, North Africa.153 In order to comprehend Regionalism, Harwell Hamilton
Harris attempted to define ‘region’ in an architectural context,
A region promotes ideas. A region accepts ideas. […] To be
expressed architecturally, an idea must be built; to be built, it
must be particularised, localised, set within a region. And what
are important are not the limitations of the region but the
resources of the region. Its most important resources are its free
minds, its imagination, its stake in the future, its energy and last
of all, its climate, its topography and the particular kind of sticks
and stones it has to build with. It is the free minds, the
imagination, the stake in the future that make up the state of
mind that is the condition necessary for any kind of regionalism
in architecture worth preserving.154

Lewis Mumford emphasised ‘culture and identity’ in a region’s architectural expression
in his book The South in Architecture (1941). He notes,
Regionalism is not a matter of using the most available local
material, or of copying some simple form of construction that our
ancestors used, for want of anything better, a century or two ago.
Regional forms are those which most closely meet the actual
conditions of life and which most fully succeed in making a
people feel at home in their environment: they do not merely
utilize the soil but they reflect the current conditions of culture in
the region.155
When a building is built, it needs time to create its story. Nurtured by nature, like a tree
spreads its branches, the built form also remains and spreads its branches through its
people and regions. Therefore, a region’s most important resource is its people and

later it connects with its climate, topography or materials. It is perhaps the mind of the
people that generates the ‘intellectual ferment necessary for greatness.’156

Scholars of Regionalism claim that climate is one of the main converters transforming
the language of international Modern Architecture to Regional architecture. In order to
express Regionalism in architecture, Hamilton and Frampton both suggest that there
must be lot of buildings built at the same time in order to generate a regional
expression which is sufficiently general as well as diverse for social or human
acceptance and which provides a climate-friendly development.157 Many scholars and
theorists have examined diverse dimensions of national and international
characteristics in order to define Regionalism. These perspectives of regionalism
along with other aspects can be found in the publication edited by Vincent B. Canizaro
entitled Architectural Regionalism: Collected Writings on Place, Identity, Modernity,
and Tradition (2007).158 Canizaro compiled various essays and articles from the
expertise body of scholarship in the field of regionalism and architecture providing
radical analyses which establish a quintessential relationship between Modern
Architecture and regionalism; and in which most arguments have one thing in
common, namely the connection between universalism and tradition.

Albert Mayer defines Regionalism as ‘a way of thinking and of feeling and of looking
at things’ which is a sense of responsibility to something much larger beyond daily life

and observation, attachment and creative work.159 James Stirling observes
Regionalism as a ‘dynamic cellularism’ that comprises architectural elements diversely
and repetitively.160 In contrast, Pallasmaa explores Regionalism in connection to his
phrase ‘diversification versus unification’ and argues that the notion of Regionalism
should connect with situational or culture-specific architecture rather than with
geographic or ethnological connotations.161 Similarly Kenza Boussora argues that
Regional architecture should be built in ‘harmony with social needs’ which requires
user participation, local materials and geographical consideration.162 Within these
requirements the concept of Regionalism can be adequately characterised. In a
geopolitical context, Pallasmaa observes that Regionalism has a tendency to turn into
‘sentimental provincialism’163 which is relatable to the postcolonial instance of East
Pakistan. Therefore, it can be assumed that the architecture of East Pakistan
represents an open confrontation between ‘the universal and the unique, the individual
and the collective, the traditional and the revolutionary.’164 Alan Colquhoun argues that
universalist and regionalist tendencies were at the heart of avant-garde modernism
and that it was inherited from Enlightenment rationalism and Romantic empiricism.165

For instance, Le Corbusier’s work demonstrates both the vernacularism as well as
industrial standardisation.166 Furthermore, Colquhoun argues that Regionalism was
formulated as a reaction against ‘the problems of rationalisation of social life under
industrial capitalism […] [and] precisely at the moment when the phenomena that it
described seemed to be threatened and about to disappear.’167 In architecture,
Regionalism assures the irreducible aspects of a local culture, such as geography,
climate and customs as these are embodied in local materials, styles, scale, and even
in local technologies and encoded space. Thus, architectural Regionalism can be
defined, as Colquhoun notes, as the ‘correlation of cultural codes with geographical
regions.’168 Similarly, Crinson argues that Regionalism definitely works with
indigenous traditions but that it fails to recognise the universal role of technological or
economic structures.169 This duality can be seen in different currents of nineteenth and
twentieth century architecture in which modernist anxieties were sometimes exploited
or brash attempts were even made in the process of the design and production of
architectural space.

In 1985, a seminar was held in Dhaka entitled ‘Regionalism in Architecture’ which
featured a wide range of discussions by renowned architects and scholars on regional
architecture across South Asia. This conference proceeding was published under the
same title representing the yearning for myriad architecture of nation-building in South
Asia that shared a common desire for international prestige and recognition coming

from both the donor and receiving countries who were engaged in the development.170
This seminar and later publication largely investigated South Asian Regional
Architecture and developed a prolific discourse between vernacular and Modern
Architecture. In the introductory chapter of this publication, Suha Özkan attempts to
differentiate vernacularism from Regionalism by outlining the works of postcolonial
native architects of the Middle East and South Asia. Özkan views the idea of
vernacularism as ‘bringing a new and contemporary existence to vernacular forms and
spatial arrangements.’171 Özkan argues modern Regionalism to be a ‘schizophrenic
mix’ of materiality and abstraction in which the structural principles of modernism are
established on the foundations of climate and cultural issues.172 However one problem
not mentioned in the various definitions of Regionalism is that there were no existing
rules of implementation that could guarantee success.173 Difficulties were also brought
to notice when foreign technologies needed to be imported to rationalise the popular
social theories of that time. For example, Hassan Fathy’s concrete-frame housing
schemes built by the government in the 1950s were far more expensive than the
transportation

the

implementations of the so-called theories of Regional Architecture. Nor was Fathy’s
agrarian romanticism with its bland and low-cost housing slabs much use in dealing
with urban poverty and overcrowding. This kind of crisis was also felt acutely in the
United Pakistan and India of the 1960s, and for East Pakistan, it was much difficult
due to the raging cold war turning into a civil war ahead.

Another important aspect of Regionalism to be discussed here is Critical Regionalism.
The concept of Critical Regionalism was introduced by Alexander Tzonis twenty-five
years ago to draw attention to the approach taken by a group of young German
architects in Europe. This group was exploring an alternative to the Postmodernism
into which Tzonis had reintroduced his historical knowledge and cultural issues in
design.174 Alongside Liane Lefaivbre, Tzonis defines Regionalism simply as the
opposite to globalism which ‘stands for the local and the specific to a region, that is to
a unique, distinct geographical area occupied homogenously by similar objects or
objects have in common characteristics.’175 However, it was Kenneth Frampton who
formally discussed Critical Regionalism in his various essays and theoretical books
published between 1987 and 1992.176 The full understanding of Critical Regionalism
by Frampton is demonstrated in Modern Architecture: A Critical History (1992).
Frampton establishes the connection between rootedness to a region and modern
innovation when initiating a new work of architecture.177 Frampton develops his
argument by using the famous essay of philosopher Paul Ricoeur entitled ‘Universal
Civilisation and National Cultures’ published in 1961. Ricoeur argues that
‘universalisation of human culture’ has been imposed globally and with the rise of
universalism, civilisation is losing diversity and local traditional cultures are

disappearing which are the ‘creative nucleus for defining place.’178 Ricoeur’s argument
is more relatable for developing countries as they required a better built environment
balancing their tradition and culture to become a part of modern civilisation. Following
Ricoeur’s passage, Frampton defines the emergence of Critical Regionalism as a selfconscious reaction to the ‘global modernisation […] with ever increasing force’ in ‘all
forms of traditional, agrarian-based, autochthonous culture.’179 Outlining renowned
architects’ work such as Jorn Utzon, Mario Botta, J. Codrech, Alvaro Siza, Tadao
Ando, Luis Barragan, Oscar Niemeyer and many more, Frampton insisted that Critical
Regionalism of these architectural endeavours cannot be regarded as style, rather it
should be considered as a process of ‘aesthetic preferences’ which is applicable in
various situations and can be ‘independently realised in a variety of locations.’180
Frampton further argues that Critical Regionalism ‘sympathise’ with universal
Modernism and at the same time contradicts it.181 Therefore, Regional and Modern
architecture are involved in a delicate balance in which Critical Regionalist architecture
is ‘identified and abstracted’ as ‘local and cultural’ amalgamated with ‘modern
practices, technologies, and economic and material conditions.’182 Architecture, for
both Ricoeur and Frampton should retain social value and settlements should not only
echo the past but also fulfil the demands of the future.

To summarise, Critical Regionalism was envisaged during the dusk of both the
International Style and Postmodern Architecture. From the aforementioned
discussions, Regionalism and Postmodernism both simultaneously generate
comprehensive concepts such as Jencks’ ‘Critical Modernism’, Pallasmaa’s ‘Second
Modernism’ and Tzonis, Lefaivre and Frampton’s ‘Critical Regionalism.’ Pallasmaa’s
concept of the Second Modernity can arguably be associated with both Critical
Modernism and Critical Regionalism. However, both have certain distinguishable
characteristics which the aforementioned theorists have repeatedly argued over.
Architecturally, Critical Modernism expresses repetition, sometimes exaggeration,
multivalence and surrealism, whilst Critical Regionalism emphasises the matter of
place and form, site specific factors and reinterprets vernacular elements and
interstices with culture.183 In both cases, they approach universal mechanisms, but
Critical Modernism points to a pragmatic rationalism whereas Critical Regionalism
looks forward to a progressive change.

The study of Regionalism becomes more complex when theorists and scholars relate
it to nationalism. In connection to nationalism and Regionalism, Harris observes that,
‘Regionalism is a state of mind, a cosmopolitan and imaginative people, and an eye
to the future.’184 On the one hand, this state of mind can be restricted spatially and can
be observed in poverty, isolation and underdevelopment, on the other hand, it can
oppose the ‘regionalism of liberation’ of a region that tunes in with the emerging
thought of the time.185 Harris observes that regional expression is the highest

Language of Post-modernism, 184-90.

expression of liberation as it represents a new diversity in a territory in every form,
such as ways of living and plans of construction.186 For example, by examining the
continual transformation between modernity and tradition in the buildings of Indonesia
and Thailand, Tan Hock Beng argues that Regionalism and the manifestation of
identity within the force of Modern Architecture includes ‘ecological consciousness as
well as the ideological quest for national roots.’187 In Bangladesh, during all the periods
of political anxiety which occurred as being either Bengal or East Pakistan, the state
of mind included an awareness of the underlying thought of the time.

A national architecture expresses the need of its people symbolically both spiritually
and physically. Like national literature, a national architecture also provides symbolic
images of the desires of the people. As a result, spiritual values in buildings often
manifest themselves at an important time in the historical development of a nation.188
Following Ricoeur’s perspective, Frampton disputes that, ‘The concept of a local or
national culture is a paradoxical proposition not only because of the present obvious
anti thesis between rooted culture and universal civilisation but also because all
cultures, both ancient and modern seemed to have dependent for their intrinsic
development on a certain cross-fertilisation with other cultures.’189 Thus, the postSecond World War epoch began with the emancipation of different architectural
cultures from an international idea. Conversely, Regionalism became a facile tool of
religious and nationalist dogmatism, and Curtis argues that it ‘left no room for the

universal aspects of both human condition and the language of art.’190 Perhaps,
nationalism in Regionalism might only succeed by the blending of the local with the
universal and the avoidance of limitations and this can lead to a lasting symbolic
resonance.191

Tropical Architecture
Tropical Architecture became a key design method in the developing countries when
Edwin Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew started their architectural practice in post-war West
Africa. Alongside practicing the methods of the tropics, these architects also wrote
about their techniques, describing their outputs as a manual. Some of the important
manifestations were published in the 1940s and 1950s such as Fry and Drew’s Village
Housing in the Tropics: with special reference to West Africa (1947), Tropical
Architecture in the Humid Zones (1956) and Tropical Architecture in the Dry and
Humid Zones (1964).192 Fry and Drew’s published books offering techniques and
theories on Tropical Architecture. These books explore the social, medical and spatial
preoccupations of British administrators earlier in the century in West Africa,
particularly in relation to public parks and open spaces enabling cleansing breezes
and improving the contact with nature. Climate was one of the first element from which
Fry and Drew abstracted modernism in order to find new characteristics in West
African architecture. Similarly, Regionalism also deals with climate, but from previous

discussions, it can be perceived that Regionalism’s major emphasis is on its region
and people, relating to tradition and national culture; and it advocates the need for
construction which simultaneously is also a response to climate. However, Tropical
Architecture generated its very existence from climate as well as from a material and
constructional rationale for planning and building.

Fry and Drew’s Tropical Architectural endeavours are discussed and analysed in Iain
Jackson and Jessica Holland’s book The Architecture of Edwin Maxwell Fry and Jane
Drew published in 2014.193 Fry and Drew’s ideas became iconic for modernisation in
postcolonial countries and many architects followed their acclaimed scientific attitude
towards architectural problem-solving. Fry and Drew had visited Accra early in 1944
and both were appointed as town planning advisers.194 They produced new prospects
of town planning and housing schemes and developed a reputation as experts in what
they would come to call ‘Tropical Architecture’ as well as designing public buildings in
the modernist idiom which they had developed during the 1930s. By the early 1950s
they were designing schools, colleges and universities, community centres, banks,
department stores and new villages and housing, all over the Gold Coast, Togo and
Nigeria. According to Crinson, what actually made the ‘Tropical Architecture’ concept
of Fry and Drew successful was that ‘they sought to transcend colonial culture with a
cosmopolitan expertise grounded in the functionalist claims of modernist architecture,

combining their claimed sympathy for the beauties of a once closely adjusted culture
and their identification with the new enlightenment of emerging independence.’195

Jiat-Hwee Chang and Anthony King investigate Tropical Architecture not as a
‘depoliticised entity’ but as a powerful tool ‘inextricably linked to asymmetrical colonial
power relations.’196 In fact, Crinson argues, ‘the discourse about Tropical Architecture’
is largely ‘a metropolitan phenomenon employing an imperial model of dissemination
in the sense that its key nodal point were architects, publishers, journals, conferences
and architectural school based on metropolis’ despite the participants were
international.197 Drawing attention to Crinson’s argument, Hanna le Roux disputes
Tropical Architecture as seen as something disparate from colonial architecture and
that ‘the influence of the metropolis on the culture of Tropical Architecture remained
significant’ mostly after independence.198 Outlining a range of examples from West
Africa during the early twentieth century, le Roux defines the concept of Tropical
Architecture as a connection emerged from ‘modern communications within the spatial
systems of colonialism’ specifically, through the cities with ‘peripheral sites of
architectural practice.’199 Fry and Drew represented Tropical Architecture as a new
innovation by arguing previous architectural buildings as being ‘instinctive,’ in which

Iain Jackson interpreted it as colonial and having little to do with climate.200 However,
Chang and King argue that this was not the real issue, for rather unlike colonial culture,
Tropical Architecture is a ‘two way exchange’ and the architectural outcome, as they
acknowledge, is ‘transculturation.’201 Furthermore Jackson explains, ‘the tropics are
not timeless or geographical places, rather shifting sites where European ideas,
political domination, knowledge and power were imposed, created and contested, with
climate nevertheless being a key influence on the architecture produced there.202
Aforementioned theories suggest that Tropical Architecture is a concept of a
sustainable society which is intertwined with the environment and its political context.

The cultural implications of Tropical Architecture were developed in tropical countries
such as Africa, India, Pakistan, Middle East, Brazil, Sri Lanka and so on. For all of
these countries, it acted as a tool for decolonisation combined with a quest for nation
building. The architecture was not directly inspired by the past but rather it stimulated
basic spatial patterns responsive to a hot climate and a beautiful landscape of
individual countries. And eventually, these tropical approaches became connected
through the architecture of different postcolonial countries and generated a unique
style of their own. For example, Balkrishna V. Doshi’s hot-dry climate courtyard
designs as related to Brahmand (earth) echo the pensive architectural reflections of
Hassan Fathy and the pavilion-in-the-garden schemes set within a hot, humid and

vegetal milieu of Geoffrey Bawa.203 Another example is the combination between
imported and native sources in the Gandhi Ashram Memorial Museum (1958-63) in
Ahmedabad designed by Charles Correa (fig. 12). Curtis explains how the building
was ‘laid out as a labyrinth of courts, shaded walkways and low pavilions traversed by
an ambling route. This weave of positive and negative spaces was held together by a
staggered grid of plain brick Piers bearing concrete lintels, waterspouts and
pyramidical tiled roofs.’204 Needless to say the museum has its obvious debts to
Corbusier’s Sarabhai House and to Kahn’s Trenton Bath House, but it also reflects
aspects of Indian character in its network of pillars and terraces which encourages the
air flow as well as allowing for easy social communication (fig 13, 14).205 Critical
Regionalism is certainly evident here as well. For South Asian cities, tropical and
regional architecture was processed by synthesising multidimensional secular and
religious traditions within the context of political turbulences.206 These heterogenous
complex identities expressed the changing cultural patterns through the region’s
radical transformation in climate friendly architecture.207

The examples discussed above were taken from emerging countries struggling with
the quest for modern national identities in their own respective ways. Modern and
Postmodern methods and mechanisms in architecture became an efficient tool to
revive ethnic culture within each country’s own environment. It can be said that
Regional and Tropical architecture are deeply integrated within these transformations.
Therefore, the concept of ‘Second Modernism’ is perhaps a formal translation
combining all of these architectural approaches collectively.

2.3.4 Paradoxes of Architectural Genealogies in Bangladeshi Nationalist
Discourse
According to the various perspectives of the scholars, it can be concluded that from
Modern, Postmodern to Regional or Tropical Architecture, there lay a hope in
producing buildings of a certain timeless character combining old and new as well as

80



local and universal. The Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo summarised this by stating,
‘art is universal, the accent is local.’208 The history of socio-culture involved a
penetration of multiple layers and an ideology created by the modernising elites. Indian
Historian Romila Thapar explained this process as, ‘each generation chooses the past
on which she wishes to draw.’209 However, it was a different situation for East Pakistan
because the emergence from the time of pre-Independence can be likened to the
move from a time of schizophrenic identity to a time of solidity and reassurance. The
identities developed from secular ideals for the nation-state ‘sought to reconcile and
integrate diverse religious and ethnic groups, regional and geographical differences,
and strident contrasts between urban and rural worlds.’210 The very notion of a national
tradition tended to mean ‘an edited version of the local past in which recent colonialism
was seen as an alien intervention’ and that became a focus point for nationalism.211

In all circumstances, architecture simply makes a connection between ideology and
form. Nonetheless, it is rooted in the ‘processes and paradoxes of society’ and within
these it also creates its own terminology in which it works collaterally but according to
different rules.212 In relation to this Curtis states, ‘The trick is to find the right balance
between the internal logic of the discipline and the influence of cultural forces, between
these social and personal dimensions, between the unique order of the individual
invention and that which is normative or typical.’213 These expressions are neither

directly political nor purely functional, but are mostly a rich mixture of ideas and forms,
thoughts derived from emblems, microcosms or the combined vision of society which
turn into ‘three-dimensional interpretations of the human condition.’214 Therefore, it can
be said that Regional and Tropical architecture in the industrial world cannot be
isolated, as it is the ‘most meaningful form of cultural survival that remains in the mind,
the strategy of resistance, the subculture that believes in searches for authenticity.’215
The mission of creating Bangladeshi architecture with its own identity lies in the
continuous development of the tradition of a socially concerned, responsive and
assimilative modernity.

2.4 Search for Identity: Dilemma between Culture and Religion
The history of postcolonial societies in a larger part of the world unfolds an obsessive
state known as the ‘search for identity.’ The previous section entitled ‘Emergence of
Bangladeshi Nationalism’ demonstrated a glimpse of the ambiguities between culture
and religion that appeared obtrusive when the social and political aspects are
investigated. The role of culture and religion became an important component of the
historiography of Bangladesh when Bengalis found themselves in dilemma of their
own ethnicity. The paradox focuses mainly on tradition or religion. More precisely, the
question is do they consider themselves Muslim or Bengali or Bangladeshi? Whilst the
idea of having a secular nation of Bangladesh came into existence after Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman’s famous speech on 7 March 1971, it is convenient to focus on the

Society," 139.

82



dilemma of being either Muslim or Bengali for the purpose of this thesis.216 This short
section will survey critical writings on the relationship between culture and religion and
how it impacted Bengal’s search for identity.

Pakistan came into being as a Muslim nation and the country’s first governor-general,
Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s role was to continue to lead Islamic monotheism throughout
the country. Only six months after Pakistan gained independence, Jinnah visited the
province of East Bengal in March 1948.217 Attending Dhaka University’s convocation,
the Qaid-e-Azam (Great Leader) addressed the students and faculties and gave his
speech on the question of national language which was already a matter of discussion
amongst citizen as it was being processed as a policy on governance. Jinnah stated
that there should be one state language for Pakistan and ‘that language should be
Urdu and cannot be any other (fig. 15).’218 Although Jinnah was ready to accept any
other language of the country (e.g. Bangla or Punjabi) as a provincial language,
stating, ‘the people can choose any language they wish’ nevertheless, he enforced,
‘there can be only one lingua franca […] for intercommunication between the various
provinces of the state.’219 However, the inhabitants of Bangla speakers outnumbered
speakers of any other language and Bengalis immediately claimed that ‘an obvious
choice for state language is the language spoken by the majority of the nation’s

216 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a historical speech during the escalating turbulence between
East and West Pakistan addressing to over two million Bengalis at the Race Course Ground in
Dhaka. Rahman declared, ‘The struggle of this hour, is the struggle for independence. The struggle of
this time, is the struggle for freedom.’ He further calls out all the citizens proclaiming, ‘Turn every
home into a fortress, and fight for liberation with whatever you have.’ See, Lawrence Ziring,

inhabitants.’220 Yet Jinnah, the nation’s leader demanded Urdu be accepted as the
national language. When the majority of the people spoke Bangla, why did Jinnah
consider Urdu more appropriate as a national language? Jinnah responded that Urdu
was understood in the majority of provinces in Pakistan and above all, that this was a
language which embodied ‘Islamic culture and Muslim countries and [was] nearest to
the languages used in other Islamic countries.’221

Jinnah’s belief of promoting and nurturing one identical language would not only
improve communications but would also represent every citizen as a national of an
Islamic nation. Although the majority of the population spoke Bangla, nonetheless,
Jinnah and other elite Muslims of West Pakistan proclaimed that Bangla did not
represent any characteristics of Muslim culture. Thus, for this particular reason,
Bangla was never accepted as the national language. In contrast, Urdu was practised
only amongst the educated elites as a South Asian Muslim language because of
scriptures, even though linguistically it was connected with Hindi. However, most

people of the Indian subcontinent would associate Urdu as a language related to the
Quran. This rhetoric was very powerful in Jinnah’s speech. Pakistan’s Muslim identity,
as Uddin argues, was directly connected ‘not only to religious tradition but also to
select languages and north-western regional customs of the Muslims.’222 As a result,
the Bengali language and regional customs were criticised and became a topic of
debate over the issues of national language and culture. West Pakistanis kept
criticising the customs and traditions of Bengali Muslims which were common to
Bengali Hindus such as practicing Rabindranath Tagore’s songs, wearing bindis and
having children studying the fine arts.223 Bengalis gradually realised these criticisms
as an inconspicuous assault on their culture and they reacted to the condemnation.
Less than three decades later, this discourse and conflict eventually broke the Muslim
nation of United Pakistan.

Partha Chatterjee, Neliesh Bose, Peter van der Veer and other scholars have
discovered that colonial experience instigated modern ways of thinking which led to
struggles and extreme protestations about religion, nation and community.224 Most of
this research often addressed the difficulties in interpreting religious tradition as
legitimate and authoritative over regional tradition. For example, India’s community
focuses on many groups, however the dominant group remains the Bharat Janata
Party (BJP), whose motive is to employ only Indic cultural roots such as Hinduism and

which largely excludes Islamic contributions. In Afghanistan, the Taliban destroyed the
Bamiyan Buddhist statues to remove the memory of historical and cultural artefacts
not connected to Islam. In the name of rebuilding and reviving the proper ‘way of life,’
these examples demonstrate a religious community envisioned from forceful actions.
Such enforcement was occurring in East Bengal, however, as Nurul Absar disputes,
the act of denying such actions was not the first time for the inhabitants as religious
discrimination had already prevailed during the 1905 Bengal Partition.225

Returning to the matter of language, Bangla is generally considered as the oldest
language closely related to Sanskrit. Through the eras of the Sultans and Mughals,
Islam began to appear in Bengal and in order to educate the peasant class, Muslim
rulers promoted literature in Bangla. Therefore, the combination of Islam and Bangla
generated a new custom, which as Uddin states, ‘appeared not just as the religion
practised by conquerors but as a tradition becoming influential’ amongst the people of
Bengal.226 Although the content of Bangla literature was transmitted, nonetheless, a
great extent of Bengali culture remains oral and relies on being transmitted orally.
Such examples are demonstrated by Zillur Khan who examines how literature became
a method of movement during the colonial state of the Indian subcontinent and how a
larger part of religious and cultural complexity occurred because of Bengal’s
undocumented past.227

In promoting Muslim nationhood, Jinnah’s statement of 1948 became the main source
of religious conflict generating what Uddin calls ‘identity politics.’228 Although
generating a discussion can be problematic here, however, to define identity politics,
referring to Anderson’s ‘imagined communities’ might be helpful.229 Identity is an
investigation of an individual self. But here I am referring to identity as a psychological
aspect of a community. Partha Chatterjee observes that the years 1905, 1947 and
1971 have been major turning points as Bengali Muslims had consecutive rises and
falls in their ideologies, ones which might direct them to imagine a community with
new ways associated with their morals and values.230 The changes in a nation’s
identity demonstrate what Chatterjee insightfully recognises as the fragility of
nationalism, which lies in the fact that a community can be imagined in a number of
ways by the very nature of being imagined.231 Shireen Osmany exemplifies
nationalism in this case as Bengalis having imagined a concept of a nation that would
share history and culture; and nationhood that would be determined by the common
bonds of language, ethnicity and religion.232 Uddin argues, Muslim nations are
motivated to promote Islamic consciousness, however, ‘understanding the nature of
who articulates orthodoxy and how it gets articulated are also paramount to this
task.’233 West Pakistan’s orthodoxically concerned policies were able to come in light
because they held the authority and power over East. Thus, as Veer observes, the
centralising force of nationalism and nation building ‘sprouts centrifugal forces’ and

crystallises other ‘dreams of nationhood.’234 The nationalism generated in East
Pakistan through religion, ethnicity, language was a counterreaction to the forging of
identity. West Pakistani leaders presumed that the partition of 1947 would solve the
problem of having a secular Muslim nation. However, this Muslim nation of United
Pakistan gave rise to frustration and dissension that ultimately led to another partition
and civil war in 1971.

When the nineteenth century Muslim elites and reformers evoked the concept of an
imagined ‘Muslim’ community suggesting several states of Muslim majority to be a
part of Pakistan, did they consider the social and economic disparities amongst the
states? For East Bengal, did they consider how to politically authorise a fragmentary
nation from this far away? The religious interest was so strong amongst these elites
and reformers that they silenced all other real political aspects such as gender, class
and race. These conflicts were visible later and produced internal paradoxes that recall
Bengal’s several partitions and precipitate secular visions of community. Uddin
argues, ‘the result is not just an opportunistic exploitation of religious commitments but
rather particular public representations of religion that engage religious commitments,
giving them priority over other factors.’235 The religious nationalism on which Pakistan
is truly based eventually had an ethnic division of Bengali and Urdu speakers and
Bengali Muslims united as a community primarily identifying with their ethno-linguistic
identity. Thus the utility of a common religious country generated by the Pakistani
leaders was fading as ‘Bengaliness’ became prominent. This instability between

religious and ethnolinguistic nationalisms resulted in a nation-state that demonstrates
transnational influences.

In the beginning, the people of Bengal had less to do with independence or nationbuilding. However, as the religio-lingual conflict predominantly took over the political
debates, East Pakistan reshaped its interest by demanding secularism to place both
religion and ethnicity in an equal sphere. The study of Bengal Muslims’ vision for an
imagined community of becoming Bangladesh indicates a complex politics of religious
and regional identity. The diverse rulers who had power over Bengal were not only
Muslims, but they were also Turks, Afghan and Persian. When British rulers arrived,
they did not ignore the religion and regional values, rather they simply wanted to
establish their authority over them. However, despite Muslim rule in India for more
than five hundred years, the British perceived the Muslim religion as foreign and
considered the Hindu community as the indigenous people of the subcontinent. Thus
the decision of partition in 1947 was based on separating two religious groups despite
the similarities in the culture and language of particular communities. Therefore,
ethno-linguistic nationalism became dominant over religious nationalism in East
Pakistan because of how the Awami League rationally connected their native
language with the rich literary heritage of Bengal and presented it to the Bengali
people. The Awami League prospered through their powerful protests in 1952 against
the Urdu language policy that remains a powerful symbol of the Bangla language.

Bengali Muslims found themselves in a cultural conflict that was parallel and
intersected with religious conflict. Uddin argues that Bengalis are largely not

89



acknowledged as a part of the larger Islamic world.236 However, there is no debate if
one chooses to be Muslim and reside in Bangladesh. Irrevocably, there is no such
thing as being truly Islamic or truly Bengali. People can be nationals of one country
and can be of any religion. The division between religion and tradition interpret only
one constant tension that is related to power, authority and economy. The nationalist
history of Bangladesh begins with establishing itself themselves through ethnic
identity, then through religious identity, later through lingual identity and lastly, through
the ‘imagined’ identity that combined all the identities in order to construct secularism.
Ranabir Samaddar argues, ‘it helps in defining the nationalism of the self, though this
act of defining is not through pure reflection, but through refraction.’237 If one connects
from the first nationalism to the last, it is evident that ‘Bengaliness’ and ‘Muslimness’;
are not antagonistic. Rather, Islam provided Bengalis with a religious ideal and being
Bengali provided a cultural pride.

2.5 Conclusion
This chapter traced the concepts of nationalism and architecture within the dogma of
cultural and religious conflicts. The thematic analysis has served as a productive lens
in order to navigate how to perceive these interpretations. The study not only reveals
the relationship between the multidisciplinary subjects, but also highlights ambiguities
which prevent this thesis from comprehensively assessing the ideological and
historical disputes. The critical dialogues investigated in this chapter produce an
immediate setting to evaluate architectural production during the era of conflicts and

emergence. The architectural reading of the case studies in relation to these
categories will form the further chapters of the research.

Chapter 3: Architecture of Bengali Identity
The formation of Pakistan was mainly based on one element – Islam as the religion.
Forming an Islamic state of Pakistan with two separate wings required regional
governing bodies, additional administration and most importantly infrastructures such
as offices and institutions to facilitate and train employees. Despite initial political
instability, the Government of Pakistan opted for various developments in the major
cities such as Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad in West Pakistan and Dhaka in East
Pakistan. These cities needed immediate attention for urban planning, housing
policies and governmental and institutional buildings. Similar to many decolonised
countries, Pakistan’s conception was to build a modern nation focussing on its identity.
This identity was principally based on religion. As a result, most of these development
projects strictly required the manifestation of Islamic expression within the modern
approach of designing the buildings. Initially both provinces of Pakistan followed the
required conceptual procedure in design and construction, however, as the political
conflict grew between the two wings, East Pakistan began to focus on its regional
identity (Bengali) more than its religious identity (Islam). Economic and political
disparities also played important roles in distinguishing the architecture of East and
West Pakistan. In East Pakistan these development projects were simultaneously
exercised by foreign, West Pakistani and East Bengali architects, however, there
remained major differences in their architectural manifestations due to their different
academic and training backgrounds. This chapter, therefore, will focus on the
differences and transformations in architectural expression which were implemented
after 1947 and onwards. The architectural analysis is divided into two sections. The

92



first section will examine selected administrative and institutional buildings designed
by both governmental and private sectors in East Pakistan. The governmental sector
consisted of works by two British architects namely, Edward Coleman Hicks and
Ronald McConnel who continued their practice from the colonial regime in the
Communications and Buildings Department (C&B); and private sectors consisting of
works by West Pakistani architect Abdul Hussain Thariani’s private firm which was
managed by his son. This analysis will assist to set a clear backdrop for the second
section in which I will focus on the architecture of the first native architect of
Bangladesh namely Muzharul Islam. In order to avoid confusion, it is important to note
that the term ‘Islam’ here refers to Muzharul’s last name and not the official religion. In
any part of the text in which confusion between the expression of the word ‘Islam’
might arise, I will include the architect’s first name. This section will analyse Islam’s
attempt to create an architectural identity by combining Bengali traditional aspects with
characteristics of Western modernism. Through selected case studies, I will explore
Islam’s diverse transition in his architectural career (academic and professional) and
his philosophies related to architecture and politics. For both sections, the architectural
readings will continue to relate to the surrounding political turbulences in order to
reflect on the trajectories of Bengali’s secularist perspective for a new identity.

3.1 Introduction
The prominent buildings designed by Muzharul Islam are acknowledged as either
‘architecture for resistance’ or ‘architecture that helped shape the nation’ by many

93



scholars.238 The inclusion of these eminent buildings is one of the vital factors to
structure this thesis, however, validating the argument of nationalism through
architecture cannot be done by solely studying the significance of Islam’s architectural
endeavours. Therefore, it is necessary to observe examples of other simultaneous
architectural praxis also being undertaken to create an Islamic United Pakistan. These
studies will be conducted by analysing the dual notions of nationalism – Pakistan’s
Islamic nationalism and East Pakistan’s Bengali nationalism. Through the lens of the
ambivalent nation building of Pakistan, this chapter will first explore the public and
institutional buildings designed by Hicks and McConnel, then Thariani’s firm and
subsequently the extensive analysis of Islam’s architectural works. The study is
organised in this way to understand not only the gradual transformation in architecture
but also to comprehend the political uncertainties in which these buildings were
constructed. There are a few scholarly writings published on Islam’s architecture,
however, apart from mere descriptions on the buildings designed by Hicks and
McConnel and Thariani’s firm, no evident scholarly analysis has been found. Thus, in
order to generate an analysis of architectural transition, my study will be focussed on
the method of observation from images and architectural drawings, interviews
conducted for this thesis and various online conferences and discussions I attended
which were organised by Bangladeshi scholars and architects during the Covid-19
Pandemic. Rather than just describing the case studies, this chapter will attempt to

238 The terms ‘architecture for resistance’ or ‘architecture that helped shape the nation’ have been
taken from various articles written by Kazi Khaleed Ashraf. Many peers and associates have agreed
with him. See, Ashraf, "Reincarnations and Independence: The Modern Architecture of South Asia.";

examine the buildings to understand the role of both government and private sectors
employed under an unstable governing system distressed by ambivalent national
identity/identities. This study will help to develop a backdrop for investigating the latter
section of this chapter in which Islam’s architecture will be explored from the sphere
of Modernism and Regionalism that attempted to answer the long-lost quest for
Bengali identity.

3.1.1 Existing Literature
The buildings of the Islamic phase in East Pakistan have always been referred to as
examples in scholarly literature, interviews and lectures. Nonetheless, in all cases, the
discussions have failed to demonstrate a critical analysis of these built forms.
Additionally, this was the era of introducing architecture as a profession to the natives.
However, the initiation of this architectural profession tends to lose limelight for
discourse in these scholarly writings. A few publications and some recent initiatives in
exploring Modern Architecture of East Pakistan, as well as interviews and field studies
conducted for this thesis, summarise an idea of the historical and cultural background
of these buildings.

Bangladeshi scholars and architects became aware of archiving their heritage and
cultural buildings in literature during the 1980s. One of the earliest books published in
relation to analysing the history of Bangladeshi architecture was written by renowned
architect and poet namely, Rabiul Hussain. Graduated from EPUET (now BUET),
Hussain started his architectural practice in the mid 1970s and almost one decade
later he published a book on the culture of architecture in Bangladesh entitled

95



Bangladesher Sthapatya Sanskriti (Architecture Culture of Bangladesh) (1985).239
Written in the Bengali language, this book is one of the first compilations and critical
analyses of buildings from the ancient period up until the independence of
Bangladesh. The former president of the Institute of Architects Bangladesh (IAB),
Hussain not only provides mere descriptions of the buildings, but his writing also
demonstrates the connection between Bengal’s rich culture and tradition. Through the
study of ancient structures, Dhaka’s urban planning, Islam’s architectural works and
Kahn’s National Capitol Complex in Dhaka, Hussain identifies various complex issues
related to the construction culture of Bangladesh. Referring to the changes in authority
over the centuries and political instabilities in the region, Hussain argues that
Bangladeshi architectural language can be only achieved if the designers understand
the cultural background of the nation.

A more focussed and comprehensive compilation of Bangladeshi architecture
between 1947 and 1980 is edited by another former president of IAB, namely Shah
Alam Zahiruddin alongside Abu H. Imamuddin and M. Mohiuddin Khan, entitled
Contemporary Architecture Bangladesh (1990). Similar to Hussain’s book, this
publication also illustrates chronological details from the ancient structures of the third
century to modern buildings up until the 1980s. However, whilst Hussain criticises the
architecture of Bangladesh from a postcolonial perspective, Zahiruddin, Imamuddin
and Khan demonstrate a more organised analysis of these buildings. The editors first
examine the political, cultural and Western influences in the country in order to explain
various types of buildings such as commercial, institutional, religious, public housing,

private residences, hospitals and recreational buildings. Throughout the study, the
development of the buildings is broadly discussed in relation to planning and
organisation of function, spatial details – forms and massing, understanding of the new
technology and materials and expression of socio-cultural and regional aspects.240

Alongside the two previous publications, an article written by the former Dean of the
Department of Architecture (BUET) (2017-19), namely Farida Nilufar provides some
insight into Bangladeshi architecture during the Pakistani era. In her article entitled
‘Architecture of Pakistan Time in Bangladesh since 1947 to 1971’ published in the
Asiatic Society of Bangladesh (2007), Nilufar identifies that there was a ‘professional
vacuum’ for architects in the beginning of Pakistan’s formation.241 Similar to Hussain
and Zahiruddin, by manifesting chronological details of buildings between 1947 and
1971, Nilufar focusses on the influence of the British style on the politically unstable
East Pakistan and explores the latter phase of the Bengali Modern Architecture by
exemplifying Islam’s architectural projects. To support Nilufar’s argument on the
professional void, an unpublished study on the overview of how the architectural
profession was introduced into East Pakistan was provided by the Chairperson of the
Department of Architecture (BRAC University), namely Zainab F. Ali, during an
interview conducted for this thesis.242 Furthermore, a recent publication by Adnan
Morshed and Nefsun Nahar entitled Dhaka in 25 Buildings (2017) provides an

overview of important architectural buildings of Dhaka.243 Despite delineating similar
case studies, these scholars perceive the pre-independent architecture of Bangladesh
from different perspectives. However, one argument remains the same: the fact that
there was a national crisis in the field of architecture in the beginning of 1947 and that
cultural discontinuity and political restlessness made it even harder. As a
consequence, buildings designed by Islam in the similar period became key
components for the scholars to analyse Modern Architecture which was not only
responsive to local climate but also manifested Bengali identity.

There are very few well-documented sources on the analysis of Muzharul Islam’s
architectural endeavours. In 1960, one of Islam’s first architectural projects (the Public
Library in Dhaka University) received international recognition in a special issue of The
Architectural Review which featured various modern architectural buildings from the
Commonwealth countries. In this issue, O. H. Koenigsberger wrote about India,
Pakistan and Ceylon’s architectural practice after independence (fig. 16).244 Whilst the
network of architectural practice rapidly expanded in India, the other two countries
were mentioned as developing regions for architectural profession. Therefore, the
article largely focussed on decolonised India’s Modern Architecture by demonstrating
Le Corbusier, Fry and Drew, Doshi and Correa’s works in Chandigarh and
Ahmedabad. The information on Pakistan and Ceylon’s architecture was minimal in
the article with examples of merely one project of Islam and two projects of Minnette
de Silva. Although the material was insufficient for latter countries, nevertheless, in the

case of Pakistan, the first architectural project after partition that was mentioned
internationally was the Public Library Building designed by Islam in East Pakistan.
Despite there being a rapid professional growth in architecture in Pakistan, this
recognition shows that how Islam was one of the very first architects to introduce
Modernism to the country (fig. 17). In 1968, a more elaborate study of Islam’s design
– a collaboration with Stanley Tigerman - was later published in the Architectural
Record.245 Written by Raymond Lifchez, this article provided studies of masterplans of
the Five Polytechnic Institutes constructed in five towns in East Pakistan (fig. 18).
Drawing attention to Islam and Tigerman’s research on tropical design and methods,
Lifchez demonstrates a meticulous study of the masterplans, main institutional
buildings and adjacent accommodations (fig. 19). The study illustrates architecture as
a rational tool conceived from congruous forms and providing an appropriate solution
for a humid climate.

The aforementioned two articles of the 1960s were based on studies related to how
western influences had been shaping the decolonised regions and how tropical
approaches introduced a new modernism. However, scholarly analysis of Islam’s
philosophy and architecture received more attention in the later stage of his career
during the late 1980s and onwards. Alongside other postcolonial architecture of South
Asia, Islam’s designs were frequently reported in the Bangladeshi architectural journal
entitled Chetana which was published in the 1980s and 1990s. Islam was the founder
of Chetana, and this journal was edited and written by Bangladesh architectural
scholars namely Kazi Khaleed Ashraf, Saiful Haque, Raziul Ahsan, Rabiul Hussain,
Shamsul Wares, Abdul Mohaimen, Jalal Ahmed and so on (fig. 20). Several issues of
Chetana documented Islam’s architectural projects from various years featuring the
drawings and photographs (fig. 21).246 However, although these articles provided
individual analysis of several of Islam’s architectural works along with some historical
background, they failed to include the deeper meaning of the concepts.247

One of the first notions of the ideologies behind Islam’s designs are manifested in the
interview conducted by Anupam Banerji published in Environments in 1988.248 This
article provided first-hand documentation of the architect by illustrating his academic
experience in the West, architectural practice during political and cultural paradoxes
and his own views as an activist about Bangladesh before independence. The
interview with Banerji became one of the authentic sources to study Islam’s designs

as related to his philosophies and was later expanded in the book, edited by Ashraf
and James Belluardo in which the building designs of Correa, Doshi, Islam and
Kanvinde were provided as examples of architecture of independence of in modern
South Asia.249 The introduction to this book was penned by Kenneth Frampton who
argued that despite the political process of upheaval, these architects ‘bound up with
[the] project of the Enlightenment’ in a territory which was unfamiliar with Modern
architectural production.250 However, a more detailed analysis of Islam’s rationalism
through his designs is illustrated in Ashraf’s chapter entitled ‘Reincarnations and
Independence: The Modern Architecture of South Asia.’ Exemplifying all four
architects, Ashraf claims Islam and Kanvinde’s architecture to be ‘real’ as they both
prioritised technology and construction techniques over symbolism and metaphors.251
Over the years, Ashraf became one of the main Bangladeshi scholars to not only vastly
researching on Islam’s architecture but also other important structures in Bangladesh
(e.g., the National Assembly Building discussed in Chapter 5) in his various articles
and books.252 One of Ashraf’s most important edited books features interview
compilations between Islam and other architectural scholars, namely Ashraf himself,
Wares and Haque, published recently in 2014. Similar to Banerji’s interview article,

this book represents a more elaborated version of Islam’s political views, upheaval in
his architectural career and design philosophies.253

Whilst Ashraf, Banerji and other scholars were publishing various traces of Islam’s
architectural works in the 1990s, simultaneously one of the leading architects in
Bangladesh namely Mohammad Foyez Ullah, was writing his masters dissertation on
Islam’s architectural works. Completed in 1997, Foyez’s unpublished thesis focusses
on an analytical method to study the conceptual frameworks of Islam’s designs.254 The
study highlights the rise and fall of Islam’s professional career in order to relate the
consistencies and dilemmas during his design process. Drawing attention to selected
buildings as case studies, Foyez’s thesis continues to interpret the underlying meaning
of Islam’s design by analysing the formal elements and architectural features. With his
elaborate study, Foyez renders a coherent depiction of Islam’s expressive
architectural vocabularies and compares the influences between his Western
academic knowledge and Eastern architectural practice. Rather than celebrating
Islam’s architecture as in previous resources, Foyez’s study provides a critical
synthesisation of the architect’s work through dialectic interpretations in the
contemporary paradigms.

Analysis of Islam’s architectural endeavours has become a more popular subject in
the present century. The University of Asia Pacific in Dhaka hosts the archive of Islam

with a small collection of architectural drawings and photographs. In 2007, a short
study of Islam’s projects was hailed as voice of Modern Bengali architecture in an
article of Rumy Nasheet and Mohammed Saadullah.255 Simultaneously in 2010 and
2011, two books were published by two major Bangladeshi institutions that included a
large compilation of Islam’s architectural projects consisting of drawings, photographs,
interviews and essays. The first book, edited by Nurur R. Khan focusses more on
Islam’s interviews, whilst the second book, published by BRAC University and edited
by Ali and Fuad Mallick provides essays written by Stanley Tigerman and Ashraf
highlighting Islam’s contribution to present architectural education and the influences
of Islam’s concept in the contemporary architecture of Bangladesh.256 A further, more
critical analysis of Islam’s first architectural project of the Fine Arts Institute in Dhaka
University has been written by Adnan Morshed which was published in the Journal of
the Society of Architectural Historians in 2017. Morshed investigates the institute as a
critical instance of Islam’s career as well as a turning point of Modern Architecture in
South Asia.257

Established in 2015, the Bengal Institute became one of the leading advocates in
publishing literature related to Islam’s contribution to his country in the field of
architecture and philosophy. Upon Islam’s death, a publication consisting of memoirs
written by several peers, apprentices, friends and family was published by Bengal
Publications in 2015. Edited by Abul Hasnat, Hussain and Tarik Sujat, this book

includes many essays expressing regret over Islam’s lack of accreditation for
architectural contributions to his country.258 Although Islam was not credited well
during his active years of profession nonetheless his projects are now largely
considered as the initiation of nationalist architecture in Bangladesh. Additionally,
numerous classes, events and conferences about Islam and South Asian architecture
have been organised by the institute on many occasions. One of the sessions worth
mentioning which was held in February 2020 and was entitled ‘Muzharul Islam and
Bengali Modernism.’ Considering both historical and cultural settings, the session
investigated and discussed Islam’s works in detail to produce materials for an
upcoming publication.259 This session featured various scholars namely, Ashraf, Sonia
Amin, Farhan Karim, Wares, Tafique Rahman Khan, Nurur Khan, Haque, Rezaul
Karim Sumon and Niklaus Graber (fig. 22).

Apart from sessions organised in Islam’s homeland, his works have also been
exhibited internationally in recent times. An exhibition entitled ‘Bengal Stream: the
Vibrant Architecture Scene of Bangladesh’ was curated by one of the international
enthusiasts of Bangladeshi architecture, Swiss architect Niklaus Graber, alongside
Andreas Ruby and Viviane Ehrensberger at the Swiss Architecture Museum in Basel
(fig. 23).260 In cooperation with the Bengal Institute, this exhibition largely focussed on

the contemporary position of Bangladeshi architecture by displaying over sixty projects
by established and emerging architects. Alongside architectural models, drawings and
photographs of Islam’s architecture the exhibition displayed his contribution as a
member of Chetana and his role as the president of IAB in 1960s with various
handwritten notes, drawings and sketches (fig. 24). An exhibition catalogue of the
same name was published covering all of the projects exhibited and the essays
contributed by the curators and scholars from Bengal Institute.261

The most recent display of Islam’s architectural projects was exhibited at the Museum
of Modern Arts (MoMA) curated by Phillip Johnson, Chief Curator of Architecture and
Design, Martino Stierli, architectural historian Anoma Pieris and former associate
curator of the museum Sean Anderson.262 The exhibition covered the countries of
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka featuring more than two hundred modern
architectural projects of the key architects namely, Doshi, Silva, Islam, Daniel
Dunham, Yasmeen Lari, Correa, Le Corbusier, Raj Rewal and so on. The architectural
model and drawings of the Fine Arts Institute alongside other drawings of Islam were
displayed at the beginning of the exhibition (fig. 25). The exhibition also displayed
Dunham and Boughey’s Kamalapur Railway Station (discussed in Chapter 4). With
the same name as the exhibition, a book was published entitled The Project of
Independence: Architectures of Decolonization in South Asia, 1947–1985; this was
not a catalogue of the displays as such but rather it consisted of critical studies of

focussed political and cultural issues related to the architecture of these postcolonial
countries.263

The aforementioned resources mostly provide an overview of the Islamic phase of
architecture in East Pakistan and Muzharul Islam’s studies are largely based on his
architectural significance. Therefore, to understand the deeper meaning of
architectural transition this analysis will also rely on interviews conducted with
architects and architectural theorists who knew and worked with Islam and some
anecdotal histories provided by his family and friends.

3.1.2 Chapter Argument
Muzharul Islam’s architecture is celebrated in the present century and his projects are
vastly considered as a resistance to the ‘domination of Western ideas and culture.’264
Nonetheless, Islam remains less recognised and less accredited for his creations
during his forty years of architectural career. Furthermore, Islam was trained as an
architect in the US and the UK and associated with many Western architects. As a
result, a lot of Western influences in Modern Architecture can be found in Islam’s
designs notwithstanding there also being evidence of Bengali architectural
characteristics too. Modern Architecture provides a link set between the past and the
future of the nation; however did Islam’s architectural vocabulary of combining Modern
and Bengali features really play any role in East Pakistan’s cultural nationalism? Was

Did Islam’s architecture really resist the religious nation building of East Pakistan?
These questions might not have any specific answers. However, by analysing the
gradual architecture transition between public buildings of modern Islamic architecture
and Islam’s architecture which was simultaneously practiced during the same period,
I will attempt to provide a better understanding of the Bengali’s choice to ‘accept’ or
‘reject’ what kind of nation building East Pakistan should have in order to answer their
search for identity in the inconsistent and contradictory paradoxical situation of
decolonisation.

3.2 The Islamic Nation: Dualism in Nationalism
When Pakistan was created with two wings, the vision was to establish a ‘unified
subcontinental Muslim culture and community.’265 For the newly built nation, therefore,
the role of religion remained a key component. This was stressed repeatedly by the
then Governor-General of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who argued that Islamic
consciousness could only hold the nation together through his Two Nations Theory.266
The development task of Pakistan was to ‘achieve a new Islamic tradition blended with
international culture whilst avoiding spiritual and ideological errors.’267 This view was
shared multiple times in the cabinet meetings held in 1948. In one of the cabinet
meetings, consulting engineer Merz Rendel Vatten stated,

265 Uddin, Constructing Bangladesh: Religion, Ethnicity, and Language in an Islamic Nation, 117.
266 Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s Two Nations Theory represented the view that Hindus and Muslims in
India constitute distinct communities having different philosophies, social customs, religious traditions,
political heroes, literature and even food and dress. See, Raja M. Ali Saleem, State, Nationalism, and
Islamization (Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2017), 34.

Pakistan stands at the entrance to its life as a free independent
nation. Economic, cultural and political conditions will differ
markedly from those of the past. These new conditions must
constitute the background for planning the capital of Pakistan.
[…] Faithful to the Islamic tradition, Pakistan will remain a
Democratic state, the country will be open to international
intercourse in all fields, economic, cultural and political, while at
the same time asserting its own individuality and that of Islam.268

In a global perspective, the 1950s and 1960s were eras in which for various
postcolonial nations Modern architecture rose in consciousness as a means of nationbuilding. Similarly, Pakistan as an independent state was following in the footsteps of
decolonisation. The only addition Pakistan wanted in establishing a new nation state
was to ensure that religious culture would have the utmost priority. However, in the
case of East Pakistan, the region entered into a domestic ‘colonialism’ without in fact
realising it. The postcolonial domestic ‘colonialism’ not only created ambivalences in
the geopolitics but also complicated the aims and ambitions of entire Pakistan. With
serious economic disparities, Pakistan’s attempt to construct an Islamic nation-state
witnessed an amplified cultural tension from the East Pakistanis which generated the
dilemma of either being a Muslim or being a Bengali. This segment intends to discuss
the ambiguities of religious and regional nationalism through the architectural
practices that were ongoing in East Pakistan. The section will seldom refer to West
Pakistani architectural practices as the political leaders kept the constructional
authority separate after 1959.

3.2.1 Islamic East Pakistan: Development or Conflict?
Immediately after Independence in 1947, Pakistan was faced with immense pressures
of resettlement that required integrated and large-scale national planning. The
challenges of resettlement accelerated as there were millions of Muslims who had
migrated from India in both wings of Pakistan. In such a context, governing two
provinces separated thousands of miles away from each other became very difficult
for the Government of Pakistan. One of the serious problems was to establish a new
executive administration as there were a very limited number of senior and
experienced officers in the central and provincial services. In 1949, the government
focussed on the resettlement problem of refugees in West Pakistan by setting up the
Thal Development Authority.269 However, East Pakistan remained largely ignored and
was treated as a rural part of the country. This planning became critical to the overall
economic development of Pakistan. The country was not fully aligned with aspects of
the new global relationship, however, the international context was favourable for the
new nations as the post-World War II situation brought ‘urban reconstruction to the
forefront of international development discourse’ and included many funding
organisations such as the United Nations (UN) and the Colombo Plan.270 These
international organisations operated rapid urbanisation in developing countries around
the world and Pakistan became one of their progressive projects. A central
government organisation known as The Planning Board which was established in
1948 consisted of both officials and non-officials as advisors. The Planning Board was
assisted by the Colombo Plan organisation and by 1950 they produced a six-year

development program. This program was gradually merged with the First Five-Year
Plan for the period between 1955 and 1960. The First Five-Year Plan was approved
by the then Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan whose vision was to produce rapid
industrialisation and financial and banking expansion. In relation to administrative
capacity, a statement was included in the First Five-Year Plan,
[…] in the period immediately ahead the inadequacy of
Pakistan’s administrative machinery will operate as the most
serious single impediment to the maximum economic use of the
country’s financial and material resources.271
Therefore, it was assumed that the training of public servants would bring special
significance as major designs were given priority for the improvement of public service.
This was recognised as an important part of the goal of national development.

Unfortunately, the lack of an adequate mechanism for the implementation of the First
Five-Year Plan and the ongoing political instability prevented the achievement of the
objectives and targets of the scheme. Additionally, despite being a part of the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, the Planning Board functioned as an independent unit. The
chairman was supposed to be the Prime Minister of Pakistan, however, within the span
of five-years, the seat of succession changed two times after the assassination of Ali
Khan.272 As a result, the Planning Board did not get much support from the larger unit
of advisors and the Prime Minister was occupied with developing a constitution. The
First Five-Year Plan scheme stretched till 1959 during which five more Prime Ministers

Administration, 1966).
272 The First Five-Year Plan was effective between 1950 and 1955 and was approved by Liaquat Ali
Khan. After his assassination in 1951, two Prime Ministers were appointed till 1955. The name of the
Prime Ministers were Khawaja Nazimuddin (1951-1953) and Mohammad Ali Bogra (1953-1955).

came into power between 1956 and 1958.273 Throughout the change in authority,
Iskandar Ali Mirza remained the President of Pakistan (1956-1958) until Ayub Khan
forcefully seized power on 27 October 1958 declaring himself as the President of
Pakistan (1959-1969).

In the meantime, the cultural confrontations amplified amongst the East Pakistanis.
These conflicts were associated with intellectual ideologies such as the continuous
criticism from West Pakistanis about the customs and traditions of Bengali Muslims as
this was also common to Bengali Hindus.274 The Bengalis of East Pakistan gradually
realised these criticisms as an inconspicuous assault on their culture and they reacted
to the condemnation. As a result, the people revolted against West Pakistan by having
a strong hold on Bengali literature. In a similar way to the Vangiya Sahitya Parishad
of Kolkata’s initiation of cultural nationalism against the colonial rulers, Dhaka also
took an initiative to produce a history of the liberal nationalist ethos which was
conducted by the Bangla Academy.275 The Bangla Academy also played a vital role in
the celebration of Pahela Baishakh (Bengali New Year) which is ‘a secular holiday that
became increasingly popular during the United Pakistan period as a symbol of
resistance to what Bengalis regarded as a form of cultural imperialism.’276 Additionally,
the school curriculum declared the mandatory study of the ancient, middle and modern
periods of Bengali history, language and literature.

273 In the span between 1956 and 1958, the Prime Ministers were Muhammad Ali (1956), H. S.
Suhrawardy (1956-1957), I. I. Chundrigar (1957) and Feroz Khan (1957-1958).
274 Chapter 2.4 discusses these criticisms in detail.

When President Khan came to power, he put a ban on the singing of Tagore songs at
festivals in an effort to integrate Bengali Muslim culture with West Pakistani Muslim
culture.277 Bengali people did not take Khan’s cultural imperialism diverted to religious
fundamentalism too well. Many poets, activists and organisations took the initiative to
protest symbolically in response to ‘what secularists perceive[d] as religious
fundamentalism.’278 With the growing rage of the 1952 Language Movement, these
restrictions seriously challenged the Bengalis into having a secular nationalist identity.
However, similar to Jinnah’s conception, Khan felt that ‘only an enemy would want to
see the separation of the United Pakistan.’279 Thus to neutralise the growing political
pressure from the East, Khan proposed strong policies of social and economic
development and announced that citizens would be able to participate in the decisionmaking process.280 On 1 May 1959, Khan issued a Basic Democracies Order in which
the local provincial governments were divided into four tiers: Union Council, Tehsil
Council, District Council and Divisional Council.281 The Basic Democracies was the
first ever reformation in Pakistani political history that attempted to build a local
administration which would involve the citizens in territorial policy-making and would
supervise the development of the industry, railways, water and power.282 However,
the system of the Basic Democracies was highly bureaucratic as the final decision
would be always made by the President and by giving control to the locals as Basic

Khan conspire to win the election of 1965.

Drawing attention to the failure of the First Five-Year Plan, Khan decided to revive and
restate the program by creating independent branches of planning department in both
wings. These departments would not only plan and coordinate agencies but also would
provide liaison between the provincial governments.283 President Khan became the
chairperson and named these agencies the ‘Planning Commission.’ This bureaucratic
office recruited experienced advisors and officials who led to the success of the
Second Five-Year Plan which began in 1960. The objective of the Second Five-Year
Plan was ‘to advance the country as far as possible within the next five years.’284 This

scheme gave highest priority to industrial development and advancement in the
education of science, technology and literature. Consequently, rapid developments in
constructing governmental and institutional buildings were initiated and people were
encouraged to pursue education and training in architecture, engineering and
technology. Within a few years, the Second Five-Year Plan succeeded in its major
goals. It would have not been possible without the political alliances with the United
States of America who built up a strategic relationship with Pakistan through Khan’s
effort (fig. 26). Alongside international funding organisations, a vast amount of aid was
offered by many associations from the US. These organisations were the United
Nations (UN), the Ford Foundation, UNESCO, US Technical Assistance and
Productivity Program (TAP) and the Harvard Advisory Group (HAG).285 In order to train
people in architecture and engineering, the Technical Education and Expertise
Enhance Programs were aided by the foreign organisations.286 Additionally, a strategy
was placed by the UN consultants, the Ford Foundation and the Pakistani government
to create prototypical models for schools, institutions and rural agricultural systems.
With colossal development projects and an unprecedented amount of aid from the
USA, the Second Five-Year Plan assisted Khan in establishing an international
reputation for Pakistan. From a political perspective, by offering tremendous support
for the development of Pakistan, the USA deployed a ‘soft power’ tactic which could
be beneficial for them in the cold war with Russia. However, major governmental and
industrial construction was implemented mostly in West Pakistan than in East
Pakistan. By taking into account of these ample fundings from foreign organisations

and President Khan’s ambition of developing a modern nation of Pakistan with
religious nationalism, the next segment will explore the constructional narrative of
Modern and Islamic architectural implementation in East Pakistan.

3.2.2 The Islamic Phase of Modernism
Initially, the design concepts for buildings in the new nation state of Pakistan almost
all followed a similar style. To a large extent, this style was a poor adaptation and
combination between European Modern Architecture and the British Empire’s IndoSaracenic ventures. As these architectural applications had proven to be suited to the
climate as well as providing moderate identity for the country, the designs were
modified by combining these with Islamic features. These patterns of buildings
became predominant in the early era of East Pakistan and were practiced by a group
of architects and engineers. This development idea resembled the British Colonial
regime’s scheme to establish power in the Indian subcontinent by amalgamating
religious elements with Euro-centric architectural features. Similar to the colonial
power formation, the strategy of the governmental supremacies was to adhere their
goals to growing tensions in East Pakistan by constructing buildings with Islamic
features.

At the beginning of Pakistan’s independence, the buildings were still constructed
according to the architectural style that the British had introduced to the region via
surveyors and engineers (discussed in Chapter 4).287 Some draftsmen who had
trained from the J. J. School of Art in Mumbai and other institutes of Kolkata supervised

287 Nilufar, "Architecture of Pakistan Time in Bangladesh since 1947 to 1971," 67.

120



most of designs and drawings. The J. J. School of Art was also actively training the
West Pakistanis, however, training architects for the Eastern wing was not yet taken
into account. Scholarships under the Post-War development were introduced and
several engineers from West Pakistan were sent to receive further education abroad
whilst East Pakistan’s situation remained in despair.288 At this point, the nation of
Pakistan emerged as the main client, however, its Eastern province remained largely
neglected and, as Karim argues, that the absence of local architects created an
‘intellectual blind spot.’289

Alongside the supervisors and draftsmen trained from Mumbai, there were two active
departments involved in the construction - the Public Works Department (PWD) and
Communications and Buildings (C&B). Whilst the PWD undertook the civil engineering
tasks mostly for roads and railways, the architectural practice was under C&B. Thus,
the responsibility of developing the new second capital of Pakistan was given to the
department of architecture at C&B. In 1948, C&B appointed its first chief architect, a
British national who was transferred from Delhi, namely Edward Coleman Hicks. When
Hicks was appointed as chief, another British architect Ronald McConnel was already
working as the assistant government architect in the office. Hicks focused on the urban
planning of Dhaka by designating future land use in different areas. In his masterplan
‘Dhaka Re-planning,’ he distinguished Motijheel as the commercial area, Nawabpur
as the shopping area, and Azimpore and Dhanmondi as the residential areas.290
Hicks’s masterplan provided some of the initial opportunities for constructing individual

buildings, such as Hotel Shahbag, New Market, Azimpore Housing and Rajarbagh
Police barracks etc. After working in East Pakistan for twelve years, Hicks left his job
in 1959. Consequently, McConnel was promoted successively to the posts of
consulting architect and town planner, government architect and finally chief architect.
McConnel served nineteen years in East Pakistan in which he designed many
important buildings for the city such as the Holy Family Hospital, Viqarunnesa Girls
School and the Nine-storied Secretariat Building etc (fig. 27). Alongside these two
British architects, another associate’s name can be found from the unpublished
document provided by Ali.291 A Pakistani architect, S. A. Asghar who had graduated
from Glasgow University, associated with Hicks and Coleman for two years in the
architectural planning and designs. However, apart from this information, no specific
official documentation has been found about Asghar’s involvement in the C&B.
Following the works of Hicks and McConnell, the government architectural offices
started to expand into the major cities of East Pakistan. In February 1949, Zaheer
Uddin Khaja joined as a junior assistant architect in the Chittagong Department of
architecture.292 This brought opportunities for city planning in Chittagong and Cox’s
Bazaar.

In 1950, an article written by Hicks for the journal Building demonstrated some of the
challenges he faced in C&B during the designing of the dwellings in East Pakistan.
Hicks mentions how the houses of ‘Muhamedan civil servants’ were constructed by
elevating the plinth of the house to prevent the dwellers from the heavy monsoon rain
and flood (fig. 28).293 He also discloses how difficult it was to find suitable materials,
East Bengal from a geographical point of view is poorly situated;
and Radcliffe Award excluded areas where limestone, sand,
ballast and cement are available. […] Bengal has no coal for
brick manufacturing and all the timber was cut down the last
season and it will be generations before the next supply.294

The difficulties in the distribution of materials were also referred to by architect
Mubassher Hussain who mentions that it was a huge challenge to bring iron rods and

124



other materials from the border of Kolkata for construction in East Pakistan.295 Hussain
also acknowledges that government assistance for construction purposes and
material supplies was often overlooked due to other political matters. In terms of
infusing religious aspects into the construction, Hicks writes that requirements for
designing an Islamic household were ‘peculiar’ in East Bengal as,
Purda (curtain) is strictly observed. A kitchen must not be
planned next to the bathroom or w.c. The bedrooms must have
a verandah where the women folk can sit unobserved, if
possible. The kitchen must be segregated from the dining room.
A visitor when he calls must be able to enter a living room which
should provide a graceful retreat unobserved by the women folk.
[…] The meals are often taken in a squatting position […] The
lavatory receptacle must not be face west or Mecca (fig. 29).296
These requirements were different from the European standards of household design.
However, Hicks managed to ensure cross-ventilations through windows, doors and
balconies despite the challenges of organising the functions in a religious way and the
unavailability of material supply. Due to the various constraints faced by Hicks, these
designs resulted in a ‘monotonous array of rooms along corridors with no reflection of
modern architecture of the west.’297 Nilufar criticises the works accomplished by C&B
as a ‘spate of Islamic Revival’ buildings which had neither spatial harmony nor
innovation.298 Nonetheless, comparing Nilufar’s criticisms with Hicks’s article which
expressed multiple obstacles, it is clear that even with the effort of the British

architects, the constructional history in the beginning of East Pakistan was a result of
severe mismanagement from the government and the offices.

The development picked up momentum during the Ayub Regime and the new state of
East Pakistan continued to be ornamented by the Islamic Revivalism that followed a
less modern architectural vocabulary. Nilufar argues that this was an era in which
buildings were ‘bland, faceless, impersonalised, institutionalised and no attempt was
made to relate them to the context.’299 The Gulistan Cinema Hall, for example,
demonstrated ‘architectural mediocrity’ in the city by flaunting flat repetitive windows
with incoherent ornamentation (fig. 30).300 The Dhaka Improvement Trust (DIT)
building designed by the architectural firm of Pakistani architect Abdulhussein Thariani
also failed in climatic significance despite the built form being considered as the city’s
landmark during this period (fig. 31). Thariani’s firm was run by his son in East Pakistan

and was eventually commissioned with many other big projects such as the Supreme
Court, Shilpakala Academy (1963) and Baitul Mukarram mosque (1960-65).
Additionally, Dhaka was blooming with opportunities and many industrial projects were
commissioned to the firm of Thariani by numerous non-Bengali businessmen and
industrialists. Within the span between 1963 and 1969, Thariani’s firm designed about
thirty industries all over East Pakistan, such as Bengal Steel Works (1963, 1965),
Bangladesh Oxygen (1965), Phyzer Pharmaceuticals Laboratory (1967-69, ICI (196769), Aero Tea factory (1967), Ordinance factory (1967-70), Alpha Tobacco (1968), Jul
Ahmed Jute Mill (1968- 70) are famous. Indeed, in the last decade prior to Pakistan’s
independence Thariani was the busiest architectural consulting firm designing
industries and multi-storied buildings in the Motijheel area. The office buildings include
the BIDC building (1963-64), Amin Court (1964-65), Bawani Chamber (1963-65),
Adamjee Court (1964-67) the Spenser Building (1966-67), the Head Office of
Bangladesh Bank (1966-69), the Head office of Sonali Bank (1968-69), the Sadharan
Bima building (1966-69) and Elaco building (1969-79). The firm also designed many
other varieties of buildings including more than fifty residences.301 Nonetheless, none
of the buildings represented any specific architectural significance except for the
Supreme Court and the Baitul Mukarram Mosque which was also designed by
Thariani’s firm. The Supreme Court was centred with an Islamic dome and expensive
surface ornamentation, and the Baitul Mukarram mosque was influenced by the shape
of Kaaba Sharif of Mecca. Both the court and the mosque demonstrated Islamic
connotations and initially the general populace started to accept these designs for their
newly built capital city (fig. 33, 34).

301 Nilufar, "Architecture of Pakistan Time in Bangladesh since 1947 to 1971," 71.

129



These diverse projects undertaken by the aforementioned architects were some of the
first Modern buildings built in Dhaka. Despite being modern in concepts in including
exposed materials and plain orthogonal blocks in their design, Nilufar argues that the
buildings did not really express ‘a socially, culturally, politically and economically
congruent and place-sensitive architecture.’302 Most of the scholars criticised that the
works of Hicks and McConnel represented a less creative and unimaginative
architecture.303 These criticisms are based on either the present situation of the
structures dispersed around Dhaka or the debates conducted by the scholars. Nilufar
notes, ‘this phase of architecture can be marked as the reflection of the formation of
Pakistan statehood.’304 Zahiruddin, Imamuddin and Khan observe that this ‘pseudoIslamic architecture’ represent a weak ‘political concept of unification of two province
with different cultural identities.’305 Nonetheless, the buildings provided some sense of
early postcolonial modernity which gradually established Dhaka as a capital city rather
than a rural province of Pakistan.

3.2.3 The Islamic Debate for a United Pakistan
With growing political tensions, the imposition of religion in construction can be
assumed as the Government of Pakistan’s tool to suppress the emergence of Bengali
nationalism. The attempt to re-establish the Mughal tradition after a break of twohundred years gave rise to many challenges in defining an architectural identity. The

130



basic question was, which style was needed to follow in this region for a Bengali
architectural identity? In relation to this, Kamil Khan Mumtaz’s discourse on Islamic
architecture in Pakistan can shed some light. Although Mumtaz’s perception of the
Islamic debate focusses on the architecture of West Pakistan, nonetheless, hierarchic
issues of designing in both wings can be seen as similar in Pakistan’s context.306 The
first issue that the East faced from West Pakistan was dominance, which reflected
patronage in social, political and economic values. The second issue was the
intellectual confidence which East Bengal gained from West Bengal after the partition
of 1905 provided a new perspective of values such as Islamic consciousness. And the
third and last issue focusses on the construction activity that was employed to build a
new tradition by completely overlooking the traditional one. These issues
fundamentally formed a different basis of identity for East Pakistan. One was secular,
physical and materialistic; the other was religious, metaphysical and spiritual.307 These
layers cannot be separated from each other, however, they can be juxtaposed as there
remains a continuous cross-fertilisation between the secular and religious aspects.
Before the language and cultural confrontations between the two provinces of
Pakistan commenced, the East had seemed quite consenting with the West for a
nation merged with an Islamic ethos. Thus, even the most secularist designed
buildings were seldom without the features that inspired the mainstream religious
nation building. Therefore, these buildings can be acknowledged as the architecture
of transformation that influenced Modern architects to design buildings in a secular
style.

3.3 The Beginning of Resistance
Much has been said about the economic disparities and development negligence of
West Pakistan over the East. Nevertheless, these brought advantages to experiment
in new ways of design styles and construction methods. Therefore, in the wake of
Modern Architecture, the postcolonial period in East Pakistan engendered diversity
and creativity. This was initiated with Muzharul Islam, who started an honourable
architectural practice amongst the natives in East Pakistan. Islam progressively
enlightened architectural endeavours against all the odds which he faced from
government bureaucracy, political domination and academic sterility. Many scholars
acknowledge him as the ‘father of Modern Architecture in the Indian subcontinent’ or
the ‘Grand Master of Regional Modernism.’308 Undoubtedly, Islam’s architectural
production engaged with climatic context and his designs indicated new ways of
creating built forms through rational concepts and using local methods in construction.
However, what has not been explored is if the buildings expressed the ethos of nation
building during the political instability and emergence of Bangladeshi nationalism. Did
Islam’s approach really represent a redemption from the ongoing architectural
practice? Did his works inspire other designers to implement new methods of design
and construction? In order to investigate these questions, this segment will examine
Islam’s architectural vocabulary that creatively synthesised Modernism with
Regionalism. The section will first overview Islam’s academic and professional career
which will provide a backdrop setting to understand his philosophies and process of

approaching architectural designs. The section will later evaluate his concepts and
methods by examining his first two designs – The Fine Arts Institute and the Public
Library built in the Dhaka University (1953-55).

3.3.1 The First Bangladeshi Architect
Muzharul Islam fought a lonely yet committed struggle during his architectural career
for over six decades. Through his works, it is evident that he distinctly acknowledged
the need for synthesising sensibilities of tradition and culture to be included in
buildings. In the Bangladeshi architectural community, Islam is recognised as one of
the most important figures, however, scholar’s observation and scrutiny of Islam’s
architectural perspectives which can be divided into two different perceptions. On the
one hand, one group of scholars criticise Islam as being a modernist, controversial
and romantic. On the other hand, another group of scholars have praised him for his
contextual approach that has promoted both humanism and individualism. Despite
these criticisms and praises, the fact still remains, as Foyez, argues that Islam has
created a nascent architectural culture in Bangladesh in spite of struggles against
political domination and academic sterility.309 Through establishing the architectural
practice amongst the natives, Islam has always been consistent in formulating a
‘Bengaliness’ in architecture.310 Islam himself stated in an interview with Ashraf that if
an architect cannot interpret tradition through his designs, it can never be a
progressive architecture.311

Islam was well aware of the political past and present during his praxis. He perceived
British colonisation much as a ‘cultural holocaust in the continuity of historical
development’ of this region.312 Islam was not emotional about the dominance, rather
he rationally and categorically attempted to portray how the culture and tradition had
been ignored and neglected over the centuries. In his interviews, Islam acknowledges
that Bengal has faced cultural and religious conundrums due to different periods of
rulers and expresses his concerns that this issue may never create a real sense of
identity from the Sultanate period till the present-day Bangladesh.313 Furthermore,
Islam was an activist and a thinker, who always expressed his concerns regarding the
current architectural educational system which was modelled on Western curricula
rather than having modifications for context. Perceiving the conflicting social and
political dilemmas, Islam turned himself to the regional manifestation of architecture
and stated,
[…] without deep roots in one’s own culture and the heritage of
the people it is not probably possible to sustain a creative life. In
this context, the regional manifestation of architecture and other
art forms is inevitable. Regionalism can only enrich the idea of
world culture – without it the world becomes very drab indeed.314

Muzharul Islam was born on the 25th of December 1923 in a village called Shundorpur
in the Murshidabad district of West Bengal (fig. 35).315 His father was a professor of
mathematics who worked throughout his career in different government colleges –
which meant that Islam’s childhood and school life were mostly spent both in West
and East Bengal. An important part of his childhood memories centred around the
Jamindarbari (the landlord’s bungalow) of his maternal grandparents in which he ‘used
to circle the bungalow and its courtyard, examining the thick walls, deep-set windows
and wooden stairs.’ It can be assumed that from childhood he developed his interests
for buildings and materiality. Overall, it can be said that his family belonged to the
financially solvent and elite class of educated Bengalis. Islam completed his middle
and high school studies in the Rajshahi district of East Bengal in 1932 and returned to

West Bengal in 1940 where he received his Bachelor of Science degree (1942).
Afterwards, he was awarded his Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree from Bengal
Engineering College within Calcutta University in 1946. In 1950, he received his
Bachelor of Architecture degree from Oregon University in the USA with the
scholarship granted under Post-War development. His journey to pursue a career in
architecture in the USA provided him with exposure to the International Style and
Modernism. For his advancement in the civil engineering degree, Islam completed his
architectural degree in two years. Upon returning in 1952, he began his early
architectural career in C&B under Ronald McConnel in East Pakistan. Around this time
Islam designed two of his most acknowledged buildings, the Fine Arts Institute and
the Public Library at Dhaka University (1953-54).

After his completion of the constructions of the Fine Arts Institute and Public Library of
Dhaka, Islam received a British Council scholarship in 1956 to study tropical
architecture at the Architectural Association (AA) in London. Afterwards, between
1958 and 1964, he was appointed as a senior architect in the government of East
Pakistan. In 1961, Islam completed his master’s degree at Yale University under the
mentorship of Paul Rudolph. Thereafter, he was awarded with the Rockefeller
Fellowship for studying the state of Contemporary Architecture in Europe and returned
to his home country in 1962 to continue his architectural practice in the government
office. Islam was amongst the first generation of native-born architects as well as being
the first to open a private architectural practice. Established in 1964, his architectural
firm was known as Vastukalabid which had a studio atmosphere as Ashraf described
in which ‘the office was the springboard for passionate movements by committed

136



young architects.’316 Islam was the President of the Institute of Architects, firstly in
Pakistan (1967-69), and then twice more in Bangladesh (1972-75 and 1975-80).
Additionally, he was a member of the first Master Jury for the Aga Khan Award for
Architecture in 1980.317

3.3.2 Searching for Bengali Identity through Architecture
After Oregon, Islam had returned to a home immersed in Bengali agitation for political
and economic emancipation. Given his own upbringing in West Bengal, Islam
developed an active fascination for politics and found himself concerned with the
problematic question of Bengali soul-searching. Islam’s academic training at Oregon
was mainly based on modern-classical architectural education which is copiously
demonstrated in his early practice. Upon returning to Dhaka as a freshly graduated
architect, Islam’s major ideas stemmed from the International Style practiced in the
West. Although his first two projects of the Fine Arts Institute and Public Library
demonstrate the contemporary Western trends, nonetheless, these designs were also
contextually appropriate with climate-friendly features and usage of materials resulting
in an explicit shift in the architecture of East Pakistan.

Islam was given responsibility to design the Fine Arts Institute on the very first day he
joined the architectural department at C&B.318 Separation from West Bengal left the
East with a void in the sectors of the arts and literature. In the wake of Partition, to
initiate a formal education in the arts with the involvement of acclaimed Bengali artist
Zainul Abedin (1914-76), the government allotted a small plot of land in the Shahbagh
area near Dhaka University and gave the design responsibility to C&B (fig. 36).319
Then chief architect of the C&B, McConnel recruited Islam to design the building
collaborating with Abedin and another famous artist Quamrul Hassan. The site was in
the surroundings of Curzon Hall (1904-08) marking the colonial footprint and Hicks
and McConnel’s Holy Family Hospital (1950) marking initial modern Islamic
architecture. Haque writes,
The area allotted for the project was a very beautiful, wooded
tract of land with a large open maidan (field) on the east, which
was used as a horse-racing course. The access road to the site
is one of the main roads of central Dhaka connecting the
University campus with the city. It also physically separates the
college site from the racing-course maidan.320

Islam started to work on the design concept for the Faculty from June to December
1953 and some of the foundation stones were laid for construction in the beginning of
1954. In order to adopt ecologically-friendly surroundings, Islam decided to keep the
existing trees on the site and placed the building by the existing vegetation in such a

way that would exclude the busy city environment and recall the rurality of Bengal.
The entrance of the building was radical echoing freedom in contrast to the highly
secured access to typical East Pakistani institutional buildings. Upon entering, the
front block consisted of a curvilinear gallery on the ground floor and atop is the
administrative offices. From the gallery space overlooking the courtyard, a freestanding staircase gently spirals upward to the faculty offices and common rooms (fig.
42). The rear block of classrooms is adjacent in a linear block stretched to the arcshaped craft rooms (fig. 39).

Although the front block of administrative offices stands on round columns similar to
the Corbusian pilotis, nonetheless, it was amalgamated with flexibility and softness by
using curvilinear walls enclosing the gallery. The upper balcony adjacent to the
administrative offices is arranged with two sleek flat slabs connected by vertical
wooden louvers representing a ‘tropical piano nobile overlooking the busy streets to
the east and green space’ on the other side (fig. 40, 44).321 Using the reinforced
concrete columns to support the slabs was a pioneering move in the history of the
construction industry of East Pakistan. Morshed observes that unlike Le Corbusier’s
Villa Savoye, the elevated open balcony – a ribbon windowed white-box and the pilotis
of the Fine Arts Institute are a ‘modern abstraction of a Mughal pavilion (fig. 45).’322
The rear blocks of classrooms and craft rooms are structured with load-bearing walls.
Setting the classrooms and craft rooms within the linear and curved shape and facing
the corridors to the west was a strategy for cross-ventilation and seeking sunlight from
the north. The curved wing was designed parallel with the existing circular pond of
seventy-five-foot radius, reminiscing the pukur (pond) around which the rural
settlements of Bengal are situated (fig. 46, 47).

The front and rear blocks demonstrate rhythmic contrast through their plan (fig. 39).
On the one hand, the front block is a free plan, on the other, the rear block is a circular
plan. The contrast created by Islam hints at ‘the genesis of a new vocabulary of his
own’ which was conceived from a concern for traditional values nevertheless delivered
as a modern expression.323 The fluid relationship of indoor and outdoor is defined by
the exposed bricks of the facades and white-coloured walls that provide an honesty to
the materials and an ambience in which to study the arts. Islam positioned his edifice
so as to be surrounded by and local landscape elements reminiscent of Corbusier’s
concept of ‘building in the park.’324 Additionally, the combination of a rectangular plinth

and curvilinear mass provide ‘a fluid gateway to an oasis-like urban complex’ – a rare
scenario in the populous city of Dhaka (fig. 48).325

Islam correspondingly designed the Public Library of Dhaka University around the
same time which is situated within walking distance of the Fine Arts Institute. The
Public Library was distinctly organised according to a Corbusian model with a cubic
massing completed with ramps, brise soleil and white-coloured facades. Ashraf
suggests that this building is one of the great examples for ‘renaissance in
contemporary architecture’ for East Pakistan.326 The dominant features in the Public
Library are the flat-roofed rectangular volumes elevated with pilotis, masses with
simpler arrangement and free-flowing spaces (fig. 49). With brick-louvered openings,
concrete frames and shell roofs, the western block of the library was designed in
contrast to the Corbusian genre of the main block (fig. 50). Foyez argues that this
contrasting element recalls the dramatic juxtaposition of two projects designed by
Corbusier – Maison Jaoul in Neuilly-sur-Seine and Petite Maison de Weekend (Villa
Felix) (fig. 52, 53).327 Furthermore, the west block’s elevation also resembles the
facades of Maison Jaoul. It can be speculated that these two projects of Corbusier
may have influenced Islam, however, the material treatment of brick walls supporting
concrete lintels and brick and concrete vaults reflected Islam’s own ‘intrinsic value for
materials’ and own choice of ventilation and structural system (fig. 51).328

With the Eurocentric tendency and careful attention to the environment, Islam’s Fine
Arts Institute and Public Library ‘cross-pollinates a humanising, modernist architectural
language with conscious considerations of climatic needs and local building
materials.’329 Islam’s design principle demonstrates ‘a concern for exploration of both
the aesthetic possibilities of indigenous building materials and for means to ensure
protection from the climate.’330 In South Asian Modern architectural literature, the Fine
Arts Institute is recognised as ‘the harbinger of Bengali modernism’ that synthesised
‘modern architectural vocabulary with climate-responsive and site-conscious’
programmes of design.331 Morshed argues that the building brings art, context and
architectural ‘elements into a self-critical but mutually beneficial dialogue.’332 At first

the Fine Arts Institute and the Public Library represent an image of the International
Style with dignified attention to the architectural elements of Bengal. The modernist
minimalism of these two projects rejected all ornamental references to the Muslim
consciousness of postcolonial Pakistan and demonstrated a sharp critique of Islam’s
politicised philosophy. Thus, the designs indicated ‘a radical break from the country’s
prevailing architectural language’ for public buildings.333 The modernism of the
institute and the library express the dual commitment of Islam to a secular Bengali
identity and universal humanity.

Was Islam searching for Bengali roots through his architectural endeavours?
Undoubtedly, yes. Islam’s search for a unique architectural identity for Bengal was
initiated through these two projects during the complex era of the Language Movement
in 1952. However, did Islam really achieve his motive of finding an architectural
vocabulary that resisted the great visions of Islamic Pakistan? Or was Islam engaging
himself in the architectural dialogue of popular Modernism with a passion for his
homeland? These questions can be explored by analysing Islam’s later projects in his
second phase of architectural practice in the next section.

3.4 The Construction of Bengali Identity
In an interview with one of the leading Bangladeshi architects, namely Ehsan Khan,
stated that Islam’s architectural career can be evaluated in three phases.334 In his
master’s thesis, Foyez also investigated Islam’s career in three distinctive periods.335

The first phase has been discussed in the previous segment and comprised Islam’s
first two designs after completing his Bachelor of Architecture from the University of
Oregon between 1952 and 1954. The most successful time in Islam’s career was the
second phase between 1963 and 1971 in which he returned from pursuing his higher
studies (from the AA School of Architecture and Yale University) and constructed and
completed his major projects amidst the ongoing crucial, political period of uncertainty
and raging civil war. Islam himself characterised the second phase as ‘interesting
years’ as he completed his prominent designs in this period. Furthermore, Dhaka was
changing due to political outrages and as an activist, Islam participated in intense
discussions during various meetings for resistance.336 The third and last phase of
Islam’s career received less recognition and accreditation and began after the
independence of Bangladesh in 1971 continuing till his demise in 2012. He repeatedly
rejected projects and provided incomplete designs. Although during this period, he
designed the Housing for Jaipurhat Limestone and Cement Factory and the National
Library and Archives (both between 1980 and 1984) nevertheless, this phase led him
to isolation resulting in almost end of his career.

This thesis examines architectural buildings of East Pakistan which were built between
1947 and 1971. Therefore, Islam’s second phase of architectural career will be
investigated in this section. In this phase, Islam not only accomplished various
projects, but this was also an era in which he engaged himself professionally with three
prominent American architects, namely Louis I. Kahn, Paul Rudolf and Stanley

336 This is stated by Islam in an interview conducted by Foyez for his master’s dissertation. See,

Tigerman who designed some of the most important buildings in Bangladesh. The
surrounding international atmosphere influenced Islam in many ways. As a
consequence, Islam’s designs shifted in a more international direction, however, his
own architectural expression with Bengali characteristics remained constant which
was a ‘distinct departure from accepted norms.’337 Islam experimented with materials,
construction and architectural elements such as planes, mass, geometry, volume and
shape in this phase all of which finally presented a notable and definitive statement
contributing to the architecture of Bangladesh. I will study selected buildings from
Islam’s second career phase in order to understand the transitions in his design
concepts and how these related to the broader analysis of Bengali Modernism and
Bangladeshi nationalism.

3.4.1 Western Influences and ‘Bengaliness’
Upon returning from abroad after completing his Yale Master’s degree, Islam’s early
projects such as the Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
Laboratories (BCSIR) (1963-65), the National Institute of Public Administration (NIPA)
(1964) and his own residence (1969) reflected the influence of certain Corbusian and
Rudolphian elements. These inspirations manifest the maturity of his design approach
through his recent exposure to the Modern Architecture of the West. The development
of a scientific and industrial research centre was high on the agenda of the Pakistani
Government which led to the commissioning of several laboratory buildings for the
Council for Scientific and Research (CSIR) all over the country.338 Islam was appointed

337 Foyez Ullah, "Search for Conceptual Framework in Architectural Works of Muzharul Islam," 13.

to design one of these major laboratories in Dhaka which was later renamed as the
Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Laboratories (BCSIR) (fig.
55). The design was a four-storied rectangular form hollowed by an internal courtyard
and laid out with grass and plants which echoed the traditional orientation of Bengal
houses with uthan (courtyard). (fig. 54)339 The problem of ventilation was carefully
solved by designing verandahs facing the internal courtyard. Also, the building’s
orientation ensured that the longer sides faced a north-south direction for crossventilation from any prevailing breeze. The east-west facades above the ground floor
were treated with perforated concrete that presented both a visual texture and worked
as a sun break-shield. The shading elements in the BCSIR building recalled Islam’s
first two projects completed ten years earlier and discussed above, namely the Fine
Arts Institute and the Public Library. The design also included an extensive landscape
most of which was never implemented during the actual construction.340

The entrance of the NIPA building was designed with repetitive columns guarding the
peripheral corridors (fig. 56). The ground floor was dedicated to administrative offices,
the first floor was facilitated with classrooms arranged by corridors on both sides whilst
the second floor consisted of larger classrooms and meeting rooms. The flat roof is
extended in all directions of the building in order to protect the interior spaces from
sunlight and heavy monsoons. The rectangular building was oriented in the direction
of east and west in order to receive more air and minimum solar heat. Foyez argues
that the climatic consideration ideas are similar to the principle of Corbusier’s ‘concrete

a gathering space for the dwellers.

parasol’ in Shodhan Villa (fig. 57).341 However, Islam blended the Corbusian influence
with his own concepts such as the corridors and classrooms of first floor which acted
as ‘inside cantilevers’ over the walkways on the ground floor.

Apart from governmental and institutional buildings, Islam designed several
residences in the 1960s which explicitly expressed elements of the International Style.
Most of these residences were built in the Dhanmondi and Gulshan areas of Dhaka.
All these residences have either been renovated or since demolished in the present
day. Unfortunately, apart from the documentation of his own residence, there is no
information on the other residences. Foyez’s thesis mentioned two residences
designed by Islam – the Ispahani House in Gulshan and the Houses for Executive
Engineers of the Roads and Highways Department. Foyez’s research remains largely
based on comparisons with Frank Lloyd Wright’s prairie houses. However, a number
of analyses exist on the design of Islam’s own residence which was built in 1969.

Islam designed his own residence as a playful intervention of shade and shadow and
the juxtaposition of materials (fig. 58, 59). Ashraf claims the umbrella roof of Islam’s
residence as recalling Corbusier’s Shodhan Villa and Kanvinde’s Harivallabhdas
House (fig. 57, 60).342 Moreover, Islam first proposed the idea of a ‘pavilion’ in a
tropical climate with the design for his residence. Geoffrey Bawa did the same with the
design for his own studio (1963) in Colombo which transposed common functions into
a unique poetic statement organised around a promenade through a sequence of
courts and enclosures protected by overhanging roofs. Curtis viewed Bawa’s Studio
as ‘a microcosm of an island’s architectural culture which fused together influences
from East and West whilst touching upon the idea of architectural origins.’343 Although
Bawa commenced his architectural practice almost seven years after Islam, it seems

both shared similar ideologies in terms of representing native traditions in a formal
architectural language.

BCSIR, NIPA and the architect’s own residence expressed ‘the power of architecture’
by demonstrating the connection and synthesisation between clear and simple forms,
plain and volume in massing and solid and void spaces. These buildings demonstrate
Islam’s deliberate attempt to consider the local climate in the ways and means of
incorporating layers of function, form and orientation in construction. The designs also
included scrutinised detailing for the layout and shape of shading devices, use of
natural light and the encouragement of airflow across buildings. The major goal was
to create a comfortable interior environment that could minimise the mechanical
cooling. These architectural vocabularies are illustrated in Islam’s other projects as
well such as the Housing of Class IV Employees (1962) on the Azimpur Estate, the
Head Quarters Building of Agricultural Development Corporation (1965-71), EFU
Building (1965-71) at Motijheel and Road Research Laboratories (1965-71). These
projects in Islam’s career provided him with opportunity to play a more ‘expressionist’
role in future Modern Architectural endeavours. In all of these buildings, Islam’s

161



designs introduced and established a strong vocabulary reflecting particular places,
people and climates with a rational reference to habitat, economy and ecology in East
Pakistan. This represented a transformation in structure from Mughal influences,
through phases of colonial concoctions, to the later pseudo-Islamic invasion of
Pakistan’s regime.

3.4.2 The Collaboration: Five Polytechnic Institutes
In light of the expansion of technical education in the country, the Second Five-Year
Plan was issued to build polytechnic education facilities in different towns and cities in
Pakistan. In 1966, the scheme was assisted and funded by the World Bank whilst the
Directorate of Technical Education specified that each campus should have facilities
and accommodation for 2,000 students.344 The academic programme was to educate
and train students who could subsequently supervise cotton, jute, gas and other
technologies in the country. Five towns – Rangpur, Pabna, Barisal, Bogra and Sylhet
were allocated in East Pakistan in which to construct these institutes. The massive
project was commissioned to Vastukalabid, the private architectural firm of Muzharul
Islam. Whilst studying at Yale together, Islam aspired to work together with his friend
Stanley Tigerman. Therefore, Islam invited Tigerman to collaborate with him in the
designs of these institutes.345

344 Foyez Ullah, "Search for Conceptual Framework in Architectural Works of Muzharul Islam," 37.
345 The first grant from the Ford Foundation was provided in 1951 to help the government establish
three polytechnic institutes and three home economics colleges both in West and East Pakistan.
Eventually, after 1951, more funding was provided by the World Bank and Doxiadis Associates was
assigned to design the West Pakistan Polytechnic Institutes (1958) whilst Islam received the
commission for the Five Polytechnic Institutes (1966-78) which he collaborated with Tigerman. See,
George F. Gant, "The Ford Foundation Program in Pakistan," Annals of the American Academy of
Political and Social Science, no. 323 (1959).

The responsibilities of the architects included site surveying, preparing masterplans,
designing individual buildings and supervising the projects. The preparation of
masterplans took almost a year as the sites were dispersed all over East Pakistan as
well as the political turbulences being at their height (fig. 61-65). The situation of
outraged protests made it very difficult for Tigerman to travel from Chicago to Dhaka,
something which is evident in his memoirs.346

The form was decided to be of simple structure with parallel brick walls and concrete
floors, a scheme that was flexible and extendable. The climatic considerations in the
design received utmost priorities for the buildings and overall masterplan. During the
design process, Tigerman revealed how differently they evaluated the climatic
problems. He writes,
The work of this fifteen-year phase generally illustrates problemsolving interpretations of the 1960s and specially that of Chicago
pragmatism. One atypical project spans almost the entire phase
- the Bangladesh Polytechnic Institutes. Style, Structural
Expression - all my earlier interests - do not form a part of the
thought process of this stage. They somehow seemed

166



inappropriate to an architecture emanating from post-Team-Ten
attitudes and other problem-solving postures of the time.347

In order to access maximum wind flow, alongside north-south orientation of the
building, the architects decided to utilised Bernoulli’s principle or the Venturi effect
which involves the energising of air movement to artificially increase its velocity.348
This principles in architecture is applied by creating stacks of planes within massing
or roof in order to provide more air movement especially at lower levels of a building
(fig. 66-68).349 This application of arranging walls decreases the pressure of hot air
created inside a building and takes in the fresh air. Islam and Tigerman sketched as
many details as they could, given the existent extreme climatic conditions of South
Asia. The construction methods and materials that they selected for the project
included using reinforced brick-bearing walls designed to resist seismic forces and
teak-louvered shutters with fly netting and terrazzo floors.350 The load-bearing
structures with their exposed brick walls ran as parallel planes in a north-south
direction whilst east-west sides were open with wooden window blinds. However,
whilst examining the buildings on site, surveyors criticised the staggered wall
treatment for making the interior darker even though shade and shadow did in fact
work well on the exterior.351

These projects were an elaborate attempt to produce prototypical components in order
to create rational and methodological principles of design for the five institutes. The
design strategies and methods were outlined by Lifchez and were based on Islam and
Tigermen’s masterplan detailing local conditions and providing an analysis of the

168



architects’ considerations and setbacks such as microclimatology, seismology and
building materials.352 The site plan and landscape design for these projects were
merged with the existing vegetation and water body. From the dwelling buildings to
the teaching buildings, all were composed in a staggered manner in order to have
natural air flow. The freestanding water tower acted as a campanile providing
hierarchy to the site (fig. 69).

During the construction of these massive projects in different locations, Tigerman and
Islam both faced heavy difficulties due to political turbulence and both travelled back
and forth between the USA and Pakistan in order to consult over the construction and

design of these Institutes. However, the project undertaken by the collaborative team
of Islam and Chicago architect Tigerman ultimately resulted in ‘extraordinary
meticulous research on form determinates in relation to tectonics, ecology, and
climatology, and material and traditional building techniques,’ in which they believed
that they were ‘contributing to the process of creating a systematic modern building
practice.’353 Furthermore, Tigerman highlighted Islam’s deep urge to seek the Bengali
identity through architectural language during this period of economic disparity and
religious perplexities.354 Considering his friend Islam’s vision for Bangladeshi
architecture, Tigerman states, ‘Everything we did was rational and well within the
modernist canon as documented in the masterplan. Our architectural training as
modernists eschewed the ornamental programs that we might otherwise have
appropriated to symbolically represent the Bengali culture.’355

3.4.3 Masterplans of the Universities
Islam’s architecture evolved and took major shifts during the development of several
masterplans and the designing individual buildings within the site plans. These
included two universities, Jahangirnagar University (1968-71) on the outskirts of
Dhaka, and Chittagong University (1965-71), plus another project which was a
housing scheme at the Jaipurhat Limestone Factory (1980-84). These projects
illustrate major transitions in Islam’s design methods in planning, arranging the
functions and synthesising the landscape. These masterplans were formed with strict

geometry in order to generate an impression of an ‘alternative city’ and move away
from the conventional morphology of city and country by formulating communal spatial
enclosures, streets and continuous facades.356 The masterplans were outlined by the
concept of a green landscape, composed of pure geometric shapes, such as squares,
rectangles and triangles which transformed the natural terrain into a scene of deep
green and clustered masses of red brick. The arrangement of different typology of
buildings in open spaces resulted in creating volumes of various shapes and sizes
forming enclosed large courtyards. The different sections of the campuses such as
the dormitories, staff quarters and academic blocks are organised focussing on the
main street axis. The different levels of building blocks generate a dynamic visual with
a careful integration with the landscape.

Chittagong University is located on hilly terrain in the south-eastern part of
Bangladesh; an ample area of 1600 acres in which almost 1200 acres are hilly areas
(fig. 70). At first, in order to understand the construction process and to survey land in
these hilly areas, four to five buildings were erected on top of the hills. Although the
buildings on the hills enhanced the visual scenario, nonetheless, the experiment
proved to be unsustainable due to the slopes of earth and did not go well because of
the sporadic erosion of land during the heavy monsoon.357 This procedure also
indicated the need for several road networks within the campus (fig. 71). Additionally,
buildings were decided to be constructed on the plateau as those areas prevent soil
erosion caused by the water running from the slope. However, the plateaus were

The original masterplan was prepared to accommodate 7500 students however the
designs were made flexible for future expansion.358 The buildings were designed with
terraces on different levels to complement the stepped character of the hilly terrain
(fig. 72-74). Individual buildings were positioned by carefully studying their functional
relationship with emphasis placed on the environmental qualities such as the
auditorium (fig. 75-77). The administrative building, faculty housing and student
dormitories were positioned on the bottom edge of the hills. The forms of these
buildings, constructed with local red bricks, were clearly generated from geometric
concepts (fig. 79-80). Rectangular in shape, each of the buildings was orientated in
the north-south direction either in a staggered way or by juxtaposing the walls (fig. 78).
Similar to Islam’s other design techniques, a sun-breaker was one of the main
considerations. The sun-breaker was designed as an extended canopy in the NIPA

In contrast to the hilly terrain of Chittagong University, the site of Jahangir Nagar
University is on a flat land. It is assumed that the physical presence of and personal
contact with Louis I. Kahn during the late 1960s may have motivated Islam to engage
with primary geometrical forms – such as square and triangles - in the masterplan of
Jahangir Nagar University (fig. 81). Foyez argues that the strategy of using a diagonal
axis to position the geometric form may have a deep inspiration from Islam’s Bauhaus
based training at Oregon.359 Both influences of Kahn and Bauhaus are evident in the
circulation focussed on one main axis surrounded by platonic forms. By forming tilted
square motifs in a network of streets, open spaces and built environments, Islam
merged architecture and urban planning in the masterplan of the university. The tilted
motifs emerged out of three-dimensional volumes and were placed one after another
in a staggered position in order to create spatial enclosures so that each building
received the same degree of sun exposure and natural ventilation. The organised tilted
square in the masterplan recalls Kahn’s Erdman Hall in Bryn Mawr College. The
principle of tilted square motifs later evolved in a more complex way in Islam’s
masterplan for Jaipurhat. Formed within a strong axis and marking a focal point for the
campus, the main triangular blocks are functioned with student dormitories, teachers’
housing and academic and administrative buildings (fig. 82-83). However, the original
designs of Islam are hardly evident in the present buildings of the university. Only a
number of buildings such as a student dormitory, reader’s quarter and an employee
housing were built according to the proposed plan by Islam (fig. 84).

The individual buildings were constructed with local red bricks, as Ashraf describes,
‘spaces and voids seem to be carved out of masonry solid [that] despite their oftencurious geometrical purity and unlike the skeletal nature of his earlier projects, form a
more earth-hugging ambiance.’360 Ehsan Khan has commented on Islam’s usage of
local brick as a path to his consciousness for nation-building.361 Khan stresses that
Islam used to consult with local brick manufacturers in order to customise brick
modules, colours and sizes which might also have had the aim to promote domestic
brick industries in the ethos of separatism from the other part of Pakistan (fig. 85,
86).362

3.5 Conclusion
Muzharul Islam’s projects between 1952 and 1971 represent ‘a great deal of
competence’ in which the influences and inspiration of Kahn and Corbusier are
evident.363 In second phase of career, Islam’s teacher Paul Rudolph and his friend
Stanley Tigerman were also instrumental in widening his social visions. Islam
formulated his own designs by exploring primary geometrical application in
architecture. Islam’s later works such as the masterplans of the universities resemble
explicitly the monumental quality of Kahn’s work. Foyez argues that in the shadow of
Kahn or Corbusier’s fundamentals, Islam may have struggled in a way to become a
‘reformist-modern’ or ‘late-modern’ architect.364 However, Islam’s experimental use of
the universal vocabulary of Modern Architecture fused with traditional style created an
architectural statement of his own. Nevertheless, why is the architect who led postpartition Modernism in the Indian subcontinent not considered as a pioneer in the
same way that Doshi and Correa of India and Mehdi Ali Mirza of Pakistan are? Both
Foyez and Ashraf argue that although Islam established a body of actual architectural
practice in East Pakistan and later in Bangladesh, nevertheless, it was not until the
late 1980s or 1990s that the theories and ideologies behind his designs were
explored.365

The designs evaluated above, undoubtedly created a new style of architecture
combined with traditional elements in the architectural realm of Bangladesh. Ashraf

confirms that there is an unexplainable sense of rootedness and ‘Bengaliness’ in
Islam’s designs.366 Islam’s architecture did not aim to address the direct line of the
Modernism. However, Modern Architecture provided Islam with a set of morals such
as methodology in planning and abstraction of forms whereas being aware of Bengali
culture and tradition provided him with a sensibility to input ethnic values in the process
of design. Bengali Modernism was arguably not an outcome of Islam’s conscious
architectural methodology, however, it may have been the result of his subconscious
inspiration emanating his Bengali mindset.

The search for Bengali identity is inherent in Islam’s work and many scholars have
related it with his philosophies of Marx. Ashraf notes Marxist approaches in Islam’s
work can be seen as commitments of political engagement.367 Islam’s political views
forms an intersection with his architectural designs. This continuing commitment to a
rationalist philosophy led Islam to his vehement antipathy towards the manipulation of
architecture and culture within a highly politicised religious situation.’368 When Islam
was asked about his philosophical approach in architecture by the chairperson of
BRAC University’s Department of Architecture, Zainab F. Ali in the series of ‘Angan’
lectures (2012), his response was simple: he designed whatever the site required in
accordance with the conditions of the surroundings and which would prove practically
functional for the users.369 There were no notions of philosophical approach in Islam’s
statement.

On evaluating Islam’s career, it is certain that his strength and values lie in the practical
architectural work rather than in theories. In fact, unlike other influential architects,
Islam's theoretical output is minimal. Although there are some citations from Bengali
newspapers in Islam’s website archive, nevertheless no published articles written by
him exists today except for the participant paper publication for the Aga Khan Award
for Architecture entitled ‘Introducing Bangladesh – A Case for Regionalism’ (1987).370
Whilst my analysis largely examines the Modern influence of Islam’s designs,
nevertheless, in this aforementioned article Islam solely included his views on
Regionalism. This may be because the seminar was on the Regional Architecture of
South Asia and Islam focussed on the history, tradition, socio-cultural and regional
manifestation of architecture. How then do his modern principles fit into the
architectural understanding of regionalism? Islam suggested that an orthodox
approach should be avoided on implying Regionalism and only by understanding
tradition can ‘real’ architecture be produced.371 This perspective can be seen as
Islam’s personal effort to incorporate his own vocabulary within Modern Architecture.
According to Ashraf, ‘what real architecture aspires to is a sort of ascetic condition,
where the goal is to gradually filter out everything conditional and extrinsic, to arrive at
an irreducible stratum where there is simple coincidence of appearance and reality,
where nothing needs to be qualified by something else.’372 These aspects are evident
in Islam’s architectural career and in his complex relationship with the politics of the
time. Islam linked architecture to a larger context of social and political issues within
South Asia. Although his practice was often interrupted, it reflected a tension between

‘social engagement and artistic autonomy’ that in turn referred to political ideology and
architectural production.373 Both Morshed and Ashraf remark that the abstractive
quality of Islam’s architecture was a method for him to ‘examine what being a secular
Bengali entailed.’374

Islam’s formation in architecture occurred after Modern Architecture was established
in the world. His academic training in Oregon and Yale introduced him to basic design,
climatic and technology application in buildings. Furthermore, Corbusier and Kahn
were a great inspiration during his professional period which demonstrated distinctive
improvisation in dealing with climatic consideration and combining modernism with
tradition. The first phase of his career designing the Fine Arts Institute and Public
Library with concepts and ideas of the International Style and amalgamating this with
Bengali culture and local materials delineates Islam’s awareness of world architecture
as well as values for tradition. The second phase of his career in the following decade
was one of the most productive periods of his life in which he designed diverse projects
such as residences, laboratories, institutions, offices and universities. This was the
period in which Islam’s designs revealed their maturity and his works were comparable
to a level of perfection that dealt not only with shapes, forms and masses but also with
context, climate and material usage. Islam’s architectural endeavours are not purely
aligned with Modernism, however, his experimentation in both geometrical designs

and climatic consideration may synthesise his architecture as a similarity and
contradiction between Modernism and Regionalism.375

The complex theory of Islam’s architecture may not be resolved from his designs, but
it can be comprehended from his struggle in his professional career which transcended
the paradox of identity and led him to isolation at the end of it. Despite this continuous
struggle, Islam kept himself active as an architect during the last phase of his career
and his architectural views and concerns continue to inspire the leading and emerging
architects of the present-day Bangladesh. Morshed remarks that ‘Islam interpreted the
prevailing political conditions in his homeland as a fateful conflict between the secular
humanist ethos of Bengal and an alien Islamist identity imposed by […] West
Pakistan.’376 Furthermore, Ashraf notes that his crucial contribution ‘was persistence
in formulating a Bengali sense of identity that permeates more than just
architecture.’377 In an interview conducted with Wares, an architecture and educator
who worked very closely in Vastukalabid with Islam, Wares asserts that Islam’s idea
of architecture was rational incorporated with modern abstraction reflecting his ‘severe
patriotism.’378 Islam’s work represents an identity true to its character which expresses
the essence of a new-born nation.379 Whilst architecture in this land was a missing
element in the Bengal Renaissance in the late nineteenth century, nevertheless,

Chapter 4: Architecture of the ‘Tropics’
Ayub Khan’s economical alliance with the USA established Pakistan as one of the
most developing countries during the 1960s. With the assistance and support of
various international foreign aid bodies and policies, Khan’s Basic Democracies and
Second Five-Year Plan required a massive institutional body to educate and train the
major population in various sectors of employment. It was necessary to build many
educational and training centres for rural and community development. Since there
were not many native architects and engineers, alongside the Government of
Pakistan, foreign aid bodies approached several American institutions to send trained
architects to collaborate and provide traineeship to the locals. This brought
opportunities for expatriate architects to work in a country which required a great deal
of modernisation as well as an articulated system for a growing industry. Most of these
architects were known for their site-specific architectural language namely,
Constantinos A. Doxiadis, Daniel C. Dunham, Robert Boughey, Paul Rudolph and
Richard Vrooman. In this chapter, I will focus on the projects of the aforementioned
architects who were recruited to work in East Pakistan during a vehement political
situation. Similar to Stanley Tigerman’s experience (discussed in Chapter 3), these
architects also faced the continuous anxiety of the raging civil war. Yet they continued
their architectural endeavours and produced some of the most important buildings that
still exist in the present-day Bangladesh. In this chapter, selected buildings will be
examined through the idea of suitable architecture for climate and context introducing
a new definition of postcolonial society.

190



4.1 Introduction
By 1961, Khan had a strong hold on the nation by stabilising the economic restraints
after establishing a strong alliance with the USA and other foreign countries. As a
result, this became an era when Pakistan embarked on colossal development projects
by receiving huge amounts of foreign funding from the Harvard Advisory Group (HAG)
and the Ford Foundation. The USA funded over 100 million dollars per year to
Pakistan through the Ford Foundation and the UN Technical Assistance
Administration. Furthermore, through the Colombo Plan, other foreign countries, such
as the UK, Canada and Australia provided 20 million US dollars per year.380
Subsequently, the government was assisted by UN consultants and the Ford
Foundation to develop schemes and prototype models for schools, institutions, rural
settlements and agricultural systems. These schemes were designed to be effective
and swift in order to accelerate self-mobilisation in the country for future development
programmes. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
assisted in the set up of an architectural department to train locals as architects and
to be self-sufficient in the technical sectors. In order to fulfil these programmes, many
international architects were invited and the priority was given to West Pakistan. Some
international architectural firms were assigned to projects in West Pakistan and later
they would be requested to work in the East such as Doxiadis. Nonetheless there were
a number of architects who were specifically recruited to work in East Pakistan. A
branch of the Louis Berger Associate & Consulting Engineering firm was established
in East Pakistan in which Dunham was assigned as the chief architect and later
replaced by Robert Boughey. Correspondingly, USAID collaborated with Texas

Agriculture and Mechanical (A&M) University to establish architectural education in
East Pakistan which brought Richard Vrooman and his colleagues to the region. This
chapter will examine the aforementioned expatriate architects’ endeavours in East
Pakistan. With selected public and institutional buildings as case studies, the
architectural analysis is divided into three sections. The first section will examine
Doxiadis’ rural interpretation of institutional buildings of East Pakistan. The second
section will study the architectural practice of Dunham as an attempt to understand
his various attempts to incorporate Modernism within climate-friendly architectural
techniques. Boughey and Rudolph’s work will be mentioned in the study of Dunham’s
designs as they worked in various parts of a similar complex. The third and last section
will analyse the importance of establishing architectural education in the region which
was assigned to Vrooman. Alongside Vrooman’s contribution to the first department
of architecture, this section will also explore his architectural association with other
American architects namely Dunham, Boughey and James C. Walden.

4.1.1 Existing Literature
Whilst the decade between the 1980s and 1990s became a period for Bangladeshi
scholars to analyse and archive Muzharul Islam’s architecture and Louis I. Kahn’s
Capitol Complex Project in Dhaka, the architecture of other expatriates remains largely
overlooked. Some of the projects such as Doxiadis’ design for the Teacher-Student
Centre (TSC) in Dhaka University and Kamalapur Railway Station in Dhaka designed
by Dunham and Boughey are acknowledged as exemplary Modern buildings in
several articles within multiple architectural instances of pre-independent Bangladesh.
However, very little has been written providing proper analyses of individual buildings.

192



In recent scholarship on Bangladeshi architecture, a few articles and book chapters
can be found which attempted to specify the architecture of Doxiadis, Dunham,
Rudolph and Boughey in East Pakistan. Thus, along with the minimal published
literature on the subject, this chapter will study these architectural buildings based on
a method of observation from images, drawings and architects’ personal notes
collected from archives and interviews conducted for this thesis.

More resources exist on Doxiadis’ architectural practice in West Pakistan than East
Pakistan. This is because his major accomplishments were in the projects developed
in West Pakistan, such as the master plan for the new capital city of Islamabad and
the refugee settlement programme in Korangi Town at Karachi. One of major writers
to analyse Doxiadis’ works is a historian from University of London namely Markus
Daechsel. In his book entitled Islamabad and the Politics of International Development
in Pakistan (2015), Daechsel provides a chronological study of Doxiadis’ life, his
principles and philosophies and how this applied to his methodologies for the projects
of Islamabad, Korangi Township and Punjab University at Lahore.381 In another article,
focussing on the study of historical ethnography in the construction of Korangi Town,
Daechsel attempts to understand Doxiadis’ design methods and principles which often
contrasted with how Ayub Khan wished to execute the projects.382 Ijlal Muzaffar also
mentions that rather than following strict ideologies of the Pakistani Government,
Doxiadis often followed the design principles most accurate for both site and

context.383 Although these scholarly writings meticulously analyse Doxiadis’ projects
in West Pakistan and seldom refer to his works in East Pakistan, nevertheless these
documents provide background information on his involvement with international
organisations such as the Ford Foundation and how his architectural firm was
commissioned for these massive projects.

Two Bangladeshi scholars namely Bayezid Ismail Choudhury and Farhan Sirajul
Karim have examined Doxiadis’ architectural works in East Pakistan. Choudhury’s
Master’s dissertation was a critical evaluation of Doxiadis’ four projects completed in
East Pakistan in which he attempts to resolve whether his design methods were
western-biased or whether there were references to the socio-cultural and climatic
context.384 By studying Doxiadis’ principle of Ekistics and ‘Real Architecture,’
Choudhury analyses the architectural drawings for the projects in order to comprehend
his technical and functional approach which would provide a more universal method
of designing than the contextual method. In contrast, Karim’s two articles on Doxiadis’
works in East Pakistan argue that how his design process offered an understanding
of rural development.385 Karim suggests that Doxiadis’ rural development programmes
in Comilla were an important transition of his design methods disseminating him from
universal modernism.

As the chief architect of Berger Associate’s East Pakistan branch, Dunham and his
family spent almost seven years in Dhaka. Within this period, Dunham not only
contributed to important architectural projects but also engaged himself with the
Bengali culture and maintained a cultural community amongst his other American
peers. The life of Dunham and his family in Dhaka is very well documented in a fivevolume book edited by his wife Mary Frances Dunham and his daughter Katherine
Dunham entitled Some Weep, Some Laugh: Memoirs of an American Family in Dacca
1960-1967 (2018).386 Alongside, the chronological details of Dunham’s architectural
journey in East Pakistan, this five-volume book also provides with instances of the
difficult situations the Dunham family had to face during the political turbulences and
how they were transported to India during the civil war. The book demonstrates useful
contextual information and photographs, however, the architectural analysis is not
sufficient for the thesis. Bangladeshi scholar Rafique Islam’s research provides more
analytical studies of Dunham’s architecture. Drawing attention upon Dunham’s
architectural education at Harvard University, Islam studies his work as a combination
of Western and regional approaches to architecture.387

Studies of Paul Rudolph’s work in East Pakistan are mostly neglected in scholarly
works. Apart from several articles mentioning that Muzharul Islam invited Rudolph to
work in his country, there are only two sources that can be found useful for this thesis.
The first is an interview between Rudolph’s associate William Grindereng and Bruce

department in the country. James C. Walden’s article entitled ‘My Dacca Days’
published in the Architectural Record (2012) and Mary F. Dunham and Kate Dunham’s

institution.391 Robert G. Boughey’s contribution to the faculty housing constructions

4.1.2 Chapter Argument
The public and institutional buildings selected as case studies in this chapter were built
when Jinnah’s Islamic nationalism converted to a nationalism in which Ayub Khan’s
most important motive was to keep alliance with the US. The buildings were
Westernised Modern architecture embedded with regional and tropical encounters.
The expatriate architects who designed these buildings were trained according to
different Western architectural backgrounds. Some of them were assigned to design
projects based on yearly contract, some of them visited the site once whilst some of
them never visited the country at all and would send architectural drawings only by
merely surveying site reports and photographs of the area. On the one hand, some
scholars argue that these projects were biased towards Western techniques and
methods whilst on the other hand some scholars have indicated a certain incorporation
of regional characteristics within the tropical construction techniques applied. Even
when Vrooman and his colleagues set up a curriculum for architectural education they
wanted to teach building techniques that could be used locally alongside universal
methods of design. However, can these architectural endeavours really be considered

197



as examples for the nation building of Bangladesh? Or were these colossal projects
true to Khan’s nationalism? During their stay and visit in Dhaka, most of the architects
experienced political setbacks and delays in their projects. Did the Bengali agitation
against the Pakistani government play any significant role during their jobs? Did it
either encourage or discourage them to develop their designs? Why did Doxiadis
attempted to interpret rural Bengali characteristics in East Pakistan in contrast to his
Islamic interpretation in West Pakistan? Why did Dunham incorporated abstracted
Islamic architectural features combined with modern and cultural connotations?
During the development of an architectural curriculum, why did the academicians
considered teaching involving the incorporation of local design methods? All of these
architects arrived from foreign countries and were given the responsibility to guide the
native inhabitants of East Pakistan. Therefore, most of them attempted to understand
the culture and tradition of the region in order to provide their knowledge and develop
their designs accordingly. The aforementioned questions cannot be answered simply;
rather they should be evaluated by overviewing the case studies. Therefore, against
the backdrop of the ample foreign funding that assisted the Pakistani Government in
these colossal development schemes and projects along with the ongoing political
crisis, I will attempt to investigate how these architects manifested their Western
knowledge of architecture in East Pakistan echoing cultural connotations and rural
interpretations.

4.2 Rural Interpretation and Provincialism
In 1958, the Greek architect and planner, Constantinos A. Doxiadis was first
commissioned to work on two projects in Pakistan (fig. 87). Firstly, as a consultant of

198



the US Technical Assistance and Productivity Program (TAP), Doxiadis Associates
(DA) were selected by UNESCO and the Ford Foundation in a joint scheme to develop
and design a large-scale programme for primary and secondary education in
Peshawar and Comilla. Secondly, DA were involved in the clearance of slums and the
resettlement of a new township in Korangi at Karachi which had originally been started
by Michel Ecochard in 1953.393 The first project was a part of a larger rural
development programme which was an important channel to mediate technical
experts in Pakistan from the US, the UN and other foreign allies. Alongside these two
projects, Pakistan became one of the biggest clients of DA and commissioned to
design other institutions. In West Pakistan, DA designed the Government Polytechnic
at Rawalpindi (1958), the Education Extension Centre (1960) and University at Punjab
(1965) at Lahore and West Pakistan Agricultural University (1965). In East Pakistan,
DA worked on the National Academy for Education Management (1959), the Home
Economics College (1961) and the Teachers and Students Centre (1963) at Dhaka.394
In a context of cultural and political crisis, DA is one of the architectural firms who
managed to complete a good number of projects in both provinces of Pakistan. This
was possible because the Ford Foundation and Government of Pakistan were aligned
to offer the architect full autonomy in design which demonstrated both local and
transnational features.395 Despite Doxiadis working in East and West Pakistan
simultaneously, there were huge differences in his design outcomes for the institutions
in regards to concept, material, colour, shape and form. As a visiting consultant and

in contrast to Muzharul Islam, the political and cultural conundrum was not a big factor
for Doxiadis. However, as a designer Doxiadis was able to detect the homogenous
past of the two wings of Pakistan such as their Mughal and Colonial rulers alongside
their cultural and political polarities in the 1960s. In this segment, I will examine the
Academy of Rural Development designed by Doxiadis in East Pakistan in order to
understand how this work distinguished itself from that constructed in West Pakistan.

4.2.1 Rural Development Programmes
The rural development programme existed before Khan came into power in the First
Five-Year Plan (1955-1960).396 The programme established in 1953 was funded by
the Village Agricultural and Development Programme (V-Aid) in assistance with the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Ford

Development Policy Institute (Pakistan: The Sustainable Development Policy Institute, 1999).

Foundation.397 The main aim for the programme was to establish education as a
process to literate the younger generation of Pakistan. In 1959, Khan took control over
the V-Aid programme and added in the existing scheme of the Basic Democracy.
Khan’s main motive was to decentralise political hierarchy and set up dispersed partial
authority in a way that it would make it difficult to challenge his dictatorial system to
rule the country.398 The V-Aid programme facilitated and modified by Khan focussed
on social and agricultural technology. At first, Peshawar and Comilla were selected for
two rural development centres in which the latter received more attention as East
Pakistan was considered to be a more vulnerable rural frontier as the land was
profitable for growing crops.399

The Ford Foundation already had a scheme developed in 1955 which was accepted
by the then Prime Minister Muhammad Ali. A technical consultant from Michigan State
University (MSU) was appointed to advance on the basic scheme by carrying out a
survey across Pakistan. Floyd Reeves, an MSU professor did the survey and
developed a proposal on budgets for roughly the first four years between 1957 and
1960. The plan was finally approved to develop academies in Peshawar and Comilla,
however, the government created separate boards to supervise the budget and
construction for the projects in each province of Pakistan. After several workshops and
seminar, the rural development programme was finalised in 1957 by the Ministry of

397 V-Aid was a scheme by the US Government to support community in Asia, Africa and Latin
America. By the end of 1960s, USAID shifted focus from community development programme to a
more technology oriented schemes such as primary and secondary education, advancement in
agricultural mechanisation and technology training. See, Nick Cullather, The Hungry World :
America's Cold War Battle against Poverty in Asia (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2022).

The programmes of rural development centres were the same for both Peshawar and
Comilla (fig. 88), however, climate and context differed greatly – mainly for the site
and environment. This is one of the main reasons the two centres were very different
from one another.400 The site for Peshawar was located in an urban setting in contrast
to the ample landscape grounds of Comilla. On the one hand, the design of the Comilla
academy was developed by ensuring cross-ventilation and using existing water tanks
and trees whilst on the other hand the Peshawar campus was designed by focussing
on the façade treatment such as smaller openings in windows with jali works as a
shading device. The buildings for the Peshawar academy were not built according to

400 Karim refers to this from the Doxiadis’ notes. See, Karim, "Interpreting Rural: Doxiadis vis-a-vis
East Pakistan," 249.

203



DA’s design as the budget did not allow for detailed jali works and needed more
simplified solutions (fig. 89). However, the Comilla academy was built according to
DA’s plan as the campus was designed as an expression of rural life with low height
blocks focussing on the horizontality of the structures (fig. 90).

The buildings in the Comilla academy were designed with large windows for crossventilation and an extended roof as a sunshade. The low height blocks of classrooms,
dormitories and cafeteria are linked with networks of shaded and columned corridors
to ensure entrance of natural light and ventilation (fig. 91-92). The large windows and
sunshades were incorporated for climatic settings nevertheless the structure recalls
the overhanging eaves (Chajja) in Mughal Architecture. The overall setting of the
complex was primarily determined by climate with north-south orientation of buildings,
façade treatment and by using local trees and plants as landscape.

For the central auditorium of the rural academy in Comilla, Doxiadis used dochala as
the form of roof – a curvilinear shaped canopy typically seen in the vernacular rural
hut of Bengal (fig. 91). The addition of a vernacular symbol demonstrates a
monumental yet rural appearance, which perhaps contrasts with the overall
philosophy of Doxiadis’ architecture. The parabolic-shaped chala had been used by
Doxiadis in his designs for the auditorium in the Home Economics College and TSC
building in Dhaka University and in the mosque of National Academy for Educational
Management. Karim argues that the metaphor Doxiadis employed exudes dual and
anachronistic meanings in which the interpretation of ruralism in East Pakistan
complicates Khan’s vision of political provincialism by development schemes.401

401 Karim, "Between Self and Citizenship: Doxiadis Associates in Postcolonial Pakistan, 1958-1968,"
148.

205



Following Karim’s argument, the next segment will examine the dual interpretation of
the roof form employed in DA’s buildings.

4.2.2 The Double Meaning – Interpreting Architecture
Despite Khan wanting to control the two wings of Pakistan centrally, politics and
economy had always marginalised East Pakistan. Cultural characteristics from Bengal
would be seen as provincial in contrast to Pakistani culture which was accepted as
national. However, the negative connotations of provincialism were perhaps
implemented with altered meaning by Doxiadis.

In comparison to the works in East Pakistan, Doxiadis undertook a higher number of
designs in West Pakistan. Therefore, he spent a substantial amount of time in West
Pakistan surveying and studying the local building construction techniques and
climatic solutions. Doxiadis perceived little knowledge of the local architecture of East
Pakistan and mostly used meteorological data to address climatic factors in this wing.
This is evident from an interview conducted by Karim in 2017 with an associate of DA,
namely Hadjopoulos published in Forum. Karim writes, ‘Hadjopoulos, a retired senior
architect of DA personally told me that Doxiadis’ approach to architecture in the
developing countries was ambivalent because, on the one hand, he preferred scientific
universalism, but on the other hand, he was genuinely eager to maintain the cultural
diversity and uniqueness of the place.’402 The implementation of the parabolic roof
reminiscent of the Bengali vernacular hut in Doxiadis’ design of East Pakistan was
inspired by two major references. The first was the ‘tropical hut’ inspired roof of the

402 Karim, "Interpreting Rural: Doxiadis vis-a-vis East Pakistan," 255.

206



dining hall of the University College of Ibadan in Nigeria designed by Fry (fig. 93). The
second was Doxiadis’ first encounter of this form during his visit to the Naulakha
Pavilion at Lahore Fort (fig. 94).403 Being inspired by a pioneering architect in tropical
design in Africa, it is likely that the rural shaped hut-roof was implemented as a
strategy to separate colonised from the coloniser. But what did Doxiadis intend to
separate by implementing chala in the context of modernism in East Pakistan?

Between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the Bengal Sultans would build
mosques in Bengal villages with dochala roofs in order to symbolise political authority
in the area.404 Similarly when Mughals started to rule in the sixteenth century, in order
to establish new areas under their authority, they would build a mosque with dochala
as a centre for the village. The parabolic roof inspired from the Bengal hut became a
symbol of Mughal authority yet still empathising with the locals by building them a
central mosque referring to their cultural past.405 The roof of the mosques during the

Mughal period manifest a double meaning – ‘a symbol for regional identity and a
political gesture of an inclusive and centralised Muslim empire.’406 Karim argues that
Doxiadis may not have shared this similar intention to symbolise the Mughal but he
was aware of the two-folded meaning of one feature.407 The incorporation of a roof
featuring symbolism from both Bengal and Mughal pasts may have been the safest
choice for Doxiadis when designing within a context of political ambivalence between
East and West Pakistan. On the one hand, the parabolic chala symbolises the
authority of West Pakistan over the East as well as recalling Islamic pasts from Mughal
period. On the other hand, the symbolic roof remains part of the Bengal heritage that
would work to Khan's advantage in the minds of the Bengali people. In both cases, the
reading of the incorporation of the curvilinear roof serves as an intricate yet complex
ideogram in a context when civil war was embroiled between the two halves of
Pakistan. Despite being commissioned by the Government of Pakistan, Doxiadis did
not hesitate to design with aspects of Bengali heritage because he had unfolded the
meaning behind dochala as Karim states, ‘his deployment of this cultural image was
intended to create a sense of territoriality on the endless sprawl of East Pakistani rural
frontier, which was misunderstood by West Pakistan.’408

Eventually, the architectural interpretation of Doxiadis’ dochala became a symbol of
the rural Bengal hut in Bangladesh. Although the notion of chala usage was prominent
in both temples and mosques, nonetheless, perceiving the final adaptation from the
Mughals, the architectural feature might have represented political authority during the

Ayub Regime. The curvilinear roof in Bengal thus demonstrates a ‘history of
reconciling the governed and governing’ and ‘the elite and the subaltern.’409 Doxiadis’
architectural interpretation of dochala may have played a similar role for a time, but it
could not bridge the gap between the authoritarian West Pakistan and discriminated
East Pakistan. Rather the dochala aspires to connect the rural and urban context of
Bangladesh up until the present day.

4.3 The American Acceleration
The rapid expansion of the USAID, the Ford Foundation and the World Bank’s
education development programmes and other schemes required more experienced
architects and engineers in Pakistan. Doxiadis was given responsibilities for several
projects in both provinces of Pakistan. However, he was mostly required to focus on
the larger projects in the West wing such as to producing an urban planning scheme
for the capital city Islamabad. In order to bring equal attention to both provinces,
USAID offered the private firm - Louis Berger Associate & Consulting Engineering –
the establishment of a subsidiary branch in East Pakistan.410 This American based
private firm was well recognised for its international architectural and engineering
endeavours. The private firm was also involved in a major commission in the taking
on of the Meghna Bridge project at Bhairab located in East Pakistan. The firm was
actively seeking opportunities for more projects in the region. Thus, in 1960, by
accepting offer from the USAID, Louis Berger Associates opened their first local
private architectural office at Jinnah Avenue located in Dhaka and appointed Daniel

C. Dunham – an American architect - as the new head of the division (fig. 95).411
Dunham actively worked as the chief architect for almost three years until he accepted
to teach as a professor in the department of architecture at EPUET. During his time
working at Louis Berger Associates, Dunham worked on a number of government
projects which was part of the development scheme funded by foreign organisations
such as the masterplans and buildings of universities located in Rajshahi,
Mymensingh and Barisal plus an important transportation hub – Kamalapur Railway
Station in Dhaka. The World Bank also commissioned Paul Rudolph in developing a
masterplan for the Agricultural University in Mymensingh in which Dunham also
designed several university buildings.412 After Dunham joined EPUET in late 1962,
Louis Berger Associates hired Robert G. Boughey as the chief architect who continued
the architectural projects of the firm.413 East Pakistan as a developing region became
a productive hub for the American architects who provided fresh insights into new
designs and construction techniques. The American development initiative is
discerned in two ways by Bangladeshi scholars. Firstly, a general overview of the
architecture is seen as Western models of design, however, construction techniques
and material application needed to be adjusted locally according to budget. Secondly,
Westernised themes of design were evident, nevertheless, like many other
postcolonial countries, climate consideration was a big factor for the architects and
eventually cultural context was taken into account by some architects especially
Dunham and Boughey.414 In this segment, I will investigate selected governmental

projects in order to understand how the aforementioned American architects perceived

4.3.1 The University Projects
In late 1960, Dunham arrived in Dhaka with his family and found himself in a crucial
position as the architectural industry was almost non-existent in East Pakistan.
Although there had been some ground-breaking projects undertaken by Islam and
Doxiadis at this point, nevertheless, it was not enough for the rapid development which
the Government of Pakistan required. Most government projects were carried out by
the PWD and Dhaka Development Trust (DIT) (now known as RAJUK) but they lacked
analytical expertise in terms of solutions suiting the local climate, materials and
212



methods. Dunham himself was freshly graduated with a Master’s degree in
Architecture from the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) and had little
experience in architectural practice (fig. 96).415 Amidst this situation, Dunham was
given an office without any trained architects, took over the continuing projects and
started several new projects (fig. 97). Mary F. Dunham writes,
Dan had to create his architecture studio from scratch: no staff,
no supplies, no equipment and no furniture. To start with, he was
given a large empty room in the four-story building on Jinnah
Avenue where Berger had their offices […] For much of his time
working at Berger, Dan was a one-man team with only a peon or
two to sharpen pencils, run errands and ply him with coffee.416
Occasionally Louis Berger would send an architect from the head office, nonetheless,
most of the works were done by Dunham himself. After a year, two American architects
– Bob Mayers and John Schiff were hired who were experienced from working in New
York. After Dunham left the firm, Boughey replaced him as the chief architect.

The consultancy firm also formed a partnership with The Engineers Ltd. which was
run by Maqbulur Rahman, Majid Khan and Sanaullah Sheikh.417 This partnership
brought opportunity for Dunham to develop a masterplan and design buildings for
Rajshahi University (RU). I have used ‘develop a masterplan’ in the previous sentence,
however, there are three different opinions have been noted about the site of RU. The
university had existed since 1953 as stated at the university entrance. However,
Rafique Islam writes that the funding was available in 1960 and approximately three
hundred hectares of land were provided to design a new campus.418 Mary Frances
states that Dunham was given a large site to re-design the masterplan.419 Upon
investigating on who designed the previous masterplan of RU, Wares mentions that

colloquially it is known that Spiro Kostof designed the first masterplan.420 Even after
visiting the site of present-day RU in 2018, Kostof’s contribution has not been
legitimated and nobody actually know who designed the masterplan before Dunham.
It was clarified by Mubassher Hussain that there was an existing masterplan in which
some of the buildings were used as classrooms for the university and Dunham was
given extra land to develop a new masterplan.421

The campus was required to act as a semi-residential university with an existing train
station on the north side of the site as it was anticipated that most of the students
would need transportation in order to come to the area. Additionally, housing and
dormitories were also required for faculties and students. Dunham’s first task was to

make a compact campus by providing all facilities within walking distance. These
facilities included the administrative building complex, a library, a convocation centre,
department buildings of various subjects, classrooms, an auditorium, a hospital, a
centre for sports and gym facilities, a mosque, staff housings and student dormitories
and botanical gardens. Dunham kept the existing mango grove and organised the
masterplan with grid-based pathways, positioning the major buildings within walking
distance (fig. 98). The administrative buildings and library in the south leads to the
central blocks of different departments and classrooms overlooking the mosque and
botanical gardens in the north. The arrangement of the garden recalls a Mughal layout
in which the prominent centre is occupied by the mosque (fig. 98). In the east section,
a sports and gym complex acts as a mediator between the academic blocks and
student dormitories. The campus was designed with sets of blocks interconnected by
roadways which recalls Western urban grid plans of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. However, with a Mughal-manner mosque and garden layout,
Dunham illustrated a hierarchy in his design as well as it connecting the region with its
Islamic past. Dunham repeated the Mughal centrepiece pattern in the design of the
Vice Chancellor’s residence in the south-west side of the site. Taking climate into
consideration, almost all of the facility buildings were positioned in a north-south
orientation to allow sun-light and to circulate air naturally (fig. 98). Dunham surveyed
other buildings in East Pakistan in which he found that the structures did not last long
due to the use of cheap materials and poor construction techniques. Therefore, for a
durable solution in both budget and foundation of the buildings, Dunham proposed
low-height buildings, mostly two or three-storied and used both good quality local and
imported material.

216



Instead of load-bearing application of brick, Dunham employed a concrete framework
to structure the student dormitories. Most of the materials such as rods, electrical and
plumbing equipment were imported which was expensive, however, the structural
elements with a proper engineering solution provided a strong massing for the
dormitory blocks (fig. 99). The library building was designed with concrete columns
and beams and exterior masonry treatment was conducted with a play of solid and
perforated patterns (fig. 100). The modern perforated masonry acted similarly to jali
and provided natural light inside the double-height library (fig. 101).

Located at the south-east corner, Dunham designed the hospital as a single-storied
building block surrounding a courtyard. Reminiscent of the rural courtyard, this form
also provided security and surveillance for a hospital as the offices, treatment rooms
and patients rooms could be approached through the common courtyard space (fig.
102).422 Similar to the other structures, Dunham used concrete columns and beams
as a structural solution filled with brick walls. The beams were projected out as
cantilevers which provided a shaded area in the entrance of the hospital blocks.
Dunham designed vaulted arched roofs with bricks above the beams for heat
absorption during the summer (fig. 103). Similar roof treatment with triangular shapes
was applied in the cafeteria building which later became a signature character for other

Louis Berger projects (fig. 104).423 Although there are scattered notions of regional
symbolism within the masterplan and in the designs of the building, nevertheless,
Dunham incorporated logical and rational climatic solutions throughout the design.
This became more prominent in his later designs for several buildings at the
Agricultural University (AU) in Mymensingh.

When Dunham was given the work of AU in 1961, a number of prominent buildings
already existed on the site such as student dormitories designed by Tigerman.424 The
exterior of the student dormitory displayed exposed brick rather than regular whitewashed stucco. Tigerman uniquely defined the exterior corners with bricks manifesting
a weaving pattern (fig. 105). Dunham designed the additional buildings which included
residence for the Vice Chancellor, a guest house, a dormitory and faculty housings.425
Subsequently, in 1965, Rudolph was appointed by the World Bank to develop a
masterplan for AU (fig. 106). It is also known from various resources that Rudolph was
Islam’s teacher at Yale University and Islam suggested the World Bank to commission
Rudolph to design AU.426 Rudolph had an ambivalent relationship with the project.
One of his associates, William Grindereng confirms in an interview, that Rudolph
reluctantly accepted the job as he was busy with his other projects in the US, thus he
visited the site a few times and never saw the project after its completion.427

426 Most of the resources mention that Islam was instrumental in inviting Tigerman, Rudolph and Kahn
to East Pakistan. The invitation of these architects occurred through various governmental projects
and Islam suggested their names as he knew them from studying in Oregon and at Yale. See, Nilufar,

The site of AU in Mymensingh was similar to the area size of RU. Although no specific
measurement of the area is mentioned, it can be speculated that AU was a more
compact area than RU according to Google Maps (fig. 107). For similar functions and
layout arrangement, Ashraf compares Rudolph’s masterplan for the University of
Massachusetts at Dartmouth (UMassD) with AU stating that the scope and complexity
of the masterplans reveals a micro-city expression and provide almost similar
prospects (fig. 108).428 However, apart from the staggered buildings echoing Brutalist
features, the masterplan arrangement of UMassD and AU are in fact very different.
The staggered classrooms of UMassD and laboratories of AU demonstrate a similar
notion to Islam and Tigerman’s Five Polytechnic Institutes proving that they were once
Rudolph’s students. In the AU, Rudolph arranged the staggered blocks in parallel at
the eastern part of the site facing in north-south orientation for natural light and
ventilation (fig. 106). In contrast, blocks of UMassD are arranged radially with slightly
shifted north-south orientation for natural light, ventilation and heat or cold absorption
for both winter and summer (fig. 108). Furthermore, UMassD’s main administration
block is a tilted square in which each linear block is stretched out from the form (fig.
108). In contrast, AU’s main laboratory block (now fisheries building) has a unique
shape in which Rudolph diagonally attached four rectangles with the main mass
creating two wings at each side (fig. 106). Exposed beams arranged in triangular
shapes create a three-dimensional experience within the courtyard which is connected
by multi-layered stairs (fig. 109-110).

The requirement for the VC residence was to design a big and comfortable house.429
Dunham situated the building in a corner to incorporate the Bengali landscape and
designed a roof deck which provided a beautiful view of the whole campus and the
Brahmaputra River. The entrance was formed by a large overhanging canopy leading
to a double-height lobby (fig. 111). The piano nobile consists of bedrooms connected
by a bridge over the lobby with a high ceiling that provides cross ventilation and an
easy flow from one space to another.430 The guest house was designed in courtyard
format in which the bedrooms were arranged surrounding an open atrium with a pool
in the middle. The roof was designed with Dunham’s unique triangular-shaped form
which allowed each room to be cooler during the heated summer (fig. 112).

Other architects are also mentioned in designing a number of buildings in the AU.
Boughey designed other additional hotels and a club house on the university campus.
The American-Austrian architect Richard Neutra is known for designing the library of
the AU. However, Neutra never visited Pakistan in the 1960s and sent the drawings
by looking at site survey and photographs.431 The library is constructed with a steel
frame skeleton and cladded in white-washed stucco (fig. 113). One side of the reading
room’s exterior is treated with wooden louvres, however, due to its orientation not

429 Mary Frances wrote, ‘The VC kept demanding “something a little larger” at each meeting.’ See,

Bangladesh," 3.
431 In mid 1950s, Neutra travelled to West Pakistan to design the Karachi Embassy (1955-56). He
surveyed well about the tropics of West Pakistan and constructed a building that perfectly responded
to the hot Karachi climate. He used the details of narrow horizontal strip windows, the use of vertical
adjustable louvers and use of water in the landscape. However, East Pakistan’s climate was different
than the West, and Neutra failed to achieve similar result as the Karachi embassy in the library
building of the AU. See, Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre, Architecture of Regionalism in the Age
of Globalization: Peaks and Valleys in the Flat World (Abingdon, New Yoek: Routledge, 2012), 143.

much light is provided inside (fig. 114). Ali and Mallick argue that because Neutra
never actually travelled to Pakistan, his design implementation of the library building,
and additional surroundings was therefore unsuitable for a hot, humid climate.432
Therefore, his lack of direct experience was responsible for the unsuccessful
construction of the floor heights plus the installation of a high roof on the shaded
pathways from which the rain could easily penetrate, for those walking beneath (fig.
115).

4.2.3 The Transportation Hub
One of the most important projects Dunham designed was the Kamalapur Railway
Station in Dhaka and it was also his last work before leaving his job with Berger
Associates (fig. 116). However, he continued to advise on the project after Boughey
was given the responsibility to supervise the construction.433 The station project
offered an opportunity to design a grand structure that would symbolise a gateway to
the capital city. The government provided land previously occupied by an abandoned
old brick building which would be replaced by this transportation hub.

Berger Associates won the contract and like many other projects, Dunham introduced
a new concept based on requirement and conditions rather than referring to past
railway stations such as the Victoria Terminus of Mumbai (now known as Chhatrapati

433 Dunham and Dunham, Some Weep, Some Laugh: Memoirs of an American Family in Dacca 19601967, Part II: Our Days, 21.

Shivaji Terminus) or Howrah Railway Station in Kolkata.434 Although Rafique Islam
states that Dunham’s first proposal for the idea of a grand railway station followed
European layouts with a two-storied arrival hall, sunken courtyard, and an
administrative building with a Victorian style clock tower, nevertheless, this is denied
by Katherine Dunham who stated that Dunham always intended to design an open-air
structure with no exterior walls for ventilation.435 Dunham proposed a design with a
vast canopied structure supported by tall columns positioned in a grid (fig. 117).
Dunham had expertise in this construction technique as he had worked on thin
concrete shell design in a workshop during his study at Harvard University (fig. 118119).436

The railway authorities required some alteration to the building in order to convey an
Islamic image, such as requesting to use vaults. Dunham knew that it was a common
practice in Pakistan to express Islamic identity through the application of symbolic
shapes to facades. Therefore, with several cases of trial and error, he modified his
design in which the roof was shaped to a pointed arch and which he described as the
‘dome umbrella scheme’ (fig. 120).’437 This shape was inspired by Mughal mosques
and mausoleums and was accepted by the railway authorities. Dunham abstracted
Islamic features and incorporated these into his technical structure which allowed

Dunham

Upon Dunham’s leaving, the designs were changed by the authorities to cut costs.
However, since Boughey was in charge of supervision, he assured that the ‘dome
umbrella scheme’ would remain unchanged (fig. 121). This was evident in a letter sent
from Boughey to Mary Frances,
I do not want you [to] feel that while you are away, I am
undermining his position. Tell Dan, I reverted back to the Dome
umbrella scheme […] and with luck will get it approved by the
governor (fig. 122).439
Kamalapur Railway Station reflects how limited available resources can still produce
great buildings. However, it is assumed that the railway authorities further intervened
during the supervision resulting in the lack of important solutions such as water
penetration during heavy rainfall. The design of the station was begun in 1962 and it
opened for service in 1968 when Dunham had already left the country. The structure
remained one of largest in Dhaka in the 1960s and is still celebrated as an icon of preindependent Modern Architecture in Bangladesh.440

4.4 Architectural Education
The establishment of formal architectural education demonstrate a prominent
transformation in the institutional historiography of Bangladesh. The book edited by
Rafique Islam and Mary F. Dunham provides a historical background of the
establishment of the first architectural department in East Pakistan’s (now
Bangladesh’s) University of Engineering and Technology (EPUET later BUET)
followed by the narratives and experiences of the foreign educators and local students
amidst the cold war context of East Pakistan. However, what has not been explored
is the role of pedagogy within the architectural culture of the region in its political
context that made the role so important. Thus, this segment reveals historical analysis
of the initiation of architectural education in Bangladesh supplemented by empirical
analysis of the pragmatic shifts in the field of architecture. I will argue that how
institutionalising architecture in a local context was indeed a pivotal moment and how
this intention unfolded radical possibilities in creating a foundation for architectural
education in Bangladesh. In this section, a critical discussion of the architectural
education establishment in East Pakistan will be included. The section will examine
the architectural pedagogy in three parts. Firstly, a historical overview of the
architecture department will be presented concerning the context in which the aids
were provided and highlighting the educators and pupils who were involved. Secondly,
an analysis of setting up the curriculum and the setbacks that had been faced by the
expatriate teachers, will feature. And thirdly, a study of the construction of the
architectural department building and its surrounding designs will be discussed, which
involved the teachers and students in the tangible sphere of introducing architecture
as a type of formal education and profession in the region. This analysis will help to

235



understand the communication between foreign and local embodiments through the
ideas of learning, building, and adapting. The study will demonstrate a critical
observation of the establishment of architectural education in East Pakistan which was
entangled with the uncertainties of the 1960s until the Liberation War.

4.4.1 Institutional Context
Before the British ruling period, there was no formal architectural education in the
Indian subcontinent. The professional training in architecture was introduced during
the colonial regime. Architectural drawings were rendered and altered for existing local
systems by British architects who would send drawings from Britain and subsequently
this would be adapted by the local draftsmen or foreign engineers according to their
regional needs.441 At first, the latter were trained by assisting European engineers in
architectural projects. However, as the demand for draftsmen and architectural
assistants grew, formal training programmes were necessary to train skilled people to
assist European architects and engineers.

There were two arts and craft schools: Sir Jamsethji Jijibhai (J. J.) School of Art in
Mumbai established in 1857 and the Mayo School of Art in Lahore established in 1875.
The curricula of these schools were devoted to art and art history. To establish a formal
training programme for architectural education, these two schools were accredited by
the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in London.442 Hence, by the early

441 Afroza Parvin and Steven Moore, "Educational Colonialism and Progress: An Enquiry into the
Architectural Pedagogy of Bangladesh," Pedagogy, Culture and Society 28, no. 1 (2020): 95,
https://doi.org/10.1080/14681366.2019.1599996.
442 RIBA was also guided by the notion of architecture as a universal discipline. Established in 1834
as a professional body for architects in Britain - shaping their relation to the state and other
professions, acting as a learned society, increasingly defining the terms of entry into the profession

236



twentieth century, both the art schools of Mumbai and Lahore had established
architectural programmes that were placed within the curriculum set by the RIBA to
prepare draftsmen and architectural assistants.443 By the end of British rule in 1947,
there were three institutions of architecture in India and one in Pakistan: Delhi
Polytechnic in Delhi, the J. J. School of Art in Mumbai, Maharaja Sivajirao University
in Baroda and the Mayo School of Art in Lahore.444 Afterwards, the five-year
programme in architecture was established in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh (then East
Pakistan), Sri Lanka and Nepal in 1945, 1958, 1961, 1965 and 1992 respectively.445
These newly founded architectural schools were modelled mainly on British or
American pedagogies or were collaborations with accredited Western universities.

Architectural education in Pakistan was initiated for the rapid need of development in
the newly-built nation. It was recognised by President Khan that ‘the concept of
education [was] a vital national investment and a major determination of the nation’s
economic growth.’446 Hence introducing education in different fields including
architecture became a part of the Second Five Year Plan (1960-65). After the Mayo
School of Art in Lahore, the PWD School of Architecture was established in Karachi.
However, neither of the institutes offered anything beyond training draftsmen and

and therefore actively shaping architectural education - the RIBA inevitably came to assume the same
functions for British Empire at the turn of the new century just as architects began to take on a more
prominent role in shaping the empire. See, Crinson, Modern Architecture and the End of Empire, 4547.
443 Anyone who completed the Matriculation exam (tenth grade) was eligible to apply for the course.
By 1930, a three-year Diploma in Architecture programme was arranged that was equivalent to
RIBA’s Intermediate exam. Even though controlled by RIBA, the courses did not aim to produce
professionals who would be able to work in Britain or anywhere else in Europe. See, Jyoti
Hosagrahar, "South Asia: Looking Back, Moving Ahead-History and Modernization," Journal of the
Society of Architectural Historians 61, no. 3 (2002): 46.

architectural assistants.447 When the Mayo School of Art in Lahore was upgraded to
the National College of Art (NCA) in 1958, it attempted to offer a decent five-year
architectural programme that could barely run its first batch of students as it was shut
down in 1962. Around this time the Moghulpara Engineering College was upgraded to
the West Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology in Lahore with a
department of architecture.448 Despite foreign aids and assistance available for both
wings of Pakistan, no record of any association with a Western university for
establishing West Pakistani architectural institutions has been found until the 1960s.
Although there were expatriate architects working in Pakistan, the architectural
educational sector in West Pakistan remained in charge of more local architects as
several pupils trained from the J. J. School of Art received further training abroad either
in the UK or in the USA. These officially recognised architects later formed the Institute
of Architects Pakistan. It had eleven members, including two foreigners working in
Pakistan namely M. A. Ahed, Tajuddin Bhabani, Minoo Mistry, Pir Mohammed, R. S.
Rustumjee, H. H. Khan, M. A. Mirza, Bloomfield, Peter Powell, A. H. Thariani and
Zahiruddin Khawaja.449

In contrast, Muzharul Islam was the only local architect in East Pakistan who was
trained as an architect in the USA. Apart from Islam, most of the architectural projects
were designed by expatriate architects who were working locally in the region. Whilst
West Pakistan was setting its own course in the sector of architectural education, East
Pakistan was assisted by the United States Agency for International Development

(USAID) to set up the first architectural department. The main goal of USAID was to
help newly-built independent nations be self-sufficient in the technical and educational
sectors by sending advisors to establish institutions in which locals would be trained
and be able to solve their own problems.450 As a consequence, the architecture
department in EPUET was established in 1961 in collaboration with Texas Agriculture
and Mechanical (A&M) University based in the USA.

The first architectural department in East Pakistan was established in the context of
post-WWII settings. One the one hand, the Second World War devastation was
focused on re-building Europe and on the other, newly independent nations were
largely ‘in need of assistance to develop their infrastructure and education system.’451
Whilst the Marshall Plan was assigned to aid European nations, there was another
alliance formed to help the developing countries. The International Co-operative
Alliance (ICA) Congress was held in Paris in 1954 and sought to technically assist
developing countries on a co-operative basis. As an extension to that, another
conference was held in 1956 specifically to manage aid with interested countries from
South-East Asia. The latter conference agreed to establish a permanent Secretariat
in South-East Asia which came into final agreement in the ICA Congress held at
Stockholm in 1957. In 1960, a regional office of the ICA was established in New
Delhi.452

Whilst this co-operative plan was exploring its horizons, the world was divided into
individual powers and influential organisations for segregated blocks of countries. The
USA had established a NATO alliance with countries in Western Europe, Russia
initiated the Warsaw pact alliance with Eastern European countries and remaining
countries formed a group of non-aligned nations.453 This was the era when the USA
became very suspicious about the nuclear development in the Soviet Union. Geoplacement of Pakistan was an advantage as it was in the south-eastern side of Russia.
Therefore, an alliance with Pakistan would have been a strategical advantage for the
USA to observe Russia. This resulted in converting the Marshall Plan into USAID with
the help of the Foreign Assistance Act in 1961. This provided a separation in funding
from the military aid to assist and administrate economic programmes in the other
parts of the world. The main objective was to help the developing countries to be selfsufficient by introducing them to programmes such as the Development Loan Fund,
Export-Import Bank and Food for Peace schemes.454 The USAID scheme continued
the ICA exchange and co-operation initiatives that had been established since 1954.

USAID then initiated a visiting teacher and student programme with the Agriculture
College in Mymensingh and then later with EPUET and Texas A&M University.455
When the Pakistani Government issued a scheme to establish a Technical University
in each wing, Ahsanullah Engineering College in Dhaka was converted into a
university in 1962. The scheme that had been in progress in the background between

Ahsanullah Engineering College (AEC) and Texas A&M University since 1954 now
finally started to create a base for a separate faculty of architecture and planning at
EPUET (fig. 123-124).456 The Director of Texas A&M Office of International
Programmes, Dr Jack D. Gray selected some teachers to set up the new Department
of Architecture. Aid was already provided as the initial plan was to educate and train
some students from the Agriculture College and Ahsanullah Engineering College in
the field of architecture. The teachers would design a curriculum, conduct entrance
exams, and select suitable students to enrol in the university. Richard Edwin Vrooman
and a few of his colleagues led this challenging job to establish an architecture
department in Dhaka.

Texas A&M University. Later, he taught architecture at Texas A&M University for fortyfive years. He also practiced architecture and in his early career, Vrooman designed
the existing All Faiths Chapel on the main campus of the university. He also produced
a book about the guidance of colour in architecture whilst working at Texas A&M.
Vrooman served as a captain in the US Army Air Corps during World War II and was
a part of the invasions of Africa and Italy. In the next phase of his life, from the 1960s,
Vrooman spent seven years of his teaching career in East Pakistan as a part of the
USAID contract with Texas A&M University. In 1961, Dhaka was a small city and ‘the
way of conducting business was reminiscent of [the] postcolonial hierarchical system
of bureaucracy.’457 Amidst this environment, setting up a new architectural school was
challenging for Vrooman. However, his dedication rewarded him with establishing an
education system that was suitable for students and teachers.

This would not have been possible if Vrooman had not built a team for the department.
Over the years, there were five American architecture professors who contributed their
knowledge to set up a suitable curriculum. In 1962, Daniel Dunham from Berger
Consultant joined the school and Vrooman’s former employee James C. Walden from
his Texas office also joined. Sam T. Lanford and Jack Yardley were recruited in 1963
and 1966 respectively (fig. 128).458 Amongst the five founding teachers, Dunham was
the only one who was brought into the team locally. Although Dunham was not
experienced in teaching, nonetheless, his familiarity with the country, culture and
people made him an obvious candidate for the job.459 Additionally, Dunham was a

practicing architect which was mutually helpful in setting up the curriculum as well as
implementing his local construction experience with the students.

4.4.2 The First Architectural Department: Curriculum
Setting up the five-year programme curriculum for the founding teachers was a big
challenge as there were no pre-existing formats available. Almost everything written
and published about the establishment of EPUET mentions the challenges and
struggles of the team in setting up the department. In his two essays about the
architecture department in Dhaka, Walden emphasises three difficulties during the job:
setting up the curriculum, giving women students the opportunity to study architecture
and the ongoing political turmoil that relatively obstructed the educational continuity.460
Walden outlines the initial struggle of setting up the department alongside Vrooman
and Dunham. He writes,
When Dik, Dan, and I landed in Dacca in early 1961, we had
nothing except our enthusiasm: no classrooms, offices,
curriculum, or students. The vice chancellor, an MIT graduate
from

Bengal,

quickly

found

space

for

us

in

existing

undistinguished buildings. We then set about devising a
curriculum for a five-year undergraduate program.461
Therefore, their first challenge was to determine what to teach and to whom they would
teach. Walden also mentions that as there was no guided handbook on starting the
architectural school, they therefore decided to start with the classical modernism of
the United States. However, on proposing the curriculum the American academics
were then instructed to include Islamic architecture. In another memoir ‘Planting the
Seeds’ Walden recalls,

460 Walden, "Memoir: My Dacca Days."; James Walden, "Planting the Seeds," in The First Faculty of
Architecture in Dhaka, ed. Rafique Islam and Mary F. Dunham (Dhaka: 2011).
461 The nickname of Vrooman and Dunham are Dik and Dan respectively. See, Walden, "Memoir: My
Dacca Days," 30.

245



As I remember it there were lengthy discussions concerning the
courses of study we should offer. There was much discussion
about integrating what we were to do in the new and different
culture of East Pakistan. There was a lot of discussion around
determining whether or not there was an Islamic architecture that
we should advocate.462

The First Faculty of Architecture in Dhaka (Dhaka: 2011), 23.

Later, they took counsel from local architects about the curriculum conundrum.
Walden mentions Muzharul Islam as one of the key local architects to advise them on
this matter.463 In terms of the dilemma of classic Modernism and Islamic architecture,
the visionary foreign architects thought ‘would we be violating sensitive elements of
the local culture?’464 This statement from Walden’s memoir manifests the risks of
creating an education system in a fragile state still in conflict to establish its identity.

246



The teachers also considered evaluating their qualifications in order to develop a
curriculum based on Islamic architecture. Walden writes, ‘None of us could even
define it. We struggled with these difficult questions but did not have answers.’465
There were two versions of the ultimate decision made by Vrooman, Dunham and
Walden. Firstly, Walden mentions that they developed a curriculum based on what
they knew and what was radical in architecture of that time.466 Therefore, the
curriculum was focused on classical Modernism and some model courses on Tropical
Architecture from the Architecture Association (AA) in London. Secondly, they did not
completely eliminate the idea of teaching Islamic architecture. Rather they developed
design studio activities which were broadly inspired by the culture of East Pakistan.467
The method of teaching included understanding the principle of architectural design
and developing skills that incorporated local materials and methods. Islam argued that
the imported and imposed system of the colonial past had changed, and people
started seeking independent ideas ‘to control their own destiny and find their own
identity.’468 Thus the architectural education in East Pakistan was organised with the
principles of the USAID programme, a teaching system that would help the locals to
solve their own design and construction challenges in the near future (fig. 128).

Another challenge was to generate an admission test that could determine the bestsuited applicants for the architectural profession. Mary F. Dunham recalls the initial
format of the admission test that was tailored to select the pupils. She writes,
They devised a new kind of exam. Instead of the typical format
that tested for memorised answers, they created open-ended
questions to determine creative potential and abilities. James
Walden remembers that the last question on the exam “asked
candidates to fold a blank piece of paper into an interesting
shape and leave it on their desk.”469

The first batch of architecture started with only six students although in the later years
the subject became popular to include more. The challenges were raised when
Vrooman and his team decided to give equal chances to everyone. This changed the

perception of ‘only rich families or men can study architecture’ as many students from
poor families or minority groups such as females or aboriginals were selected for
admission.470 Walden recalls,
Even though it went against the norm, we decided to accept
female students. In the end, our inaugural class, in the fall of
1961, comprised 26 men and three women.471

In the 1960s, it was seldom to encounter women in any institution or profession in East
Pakistan due to the conservative Islamic culture. Indeed it was rare to witness any
women studying after their high school education. However, the culture of Bengal was

more open to allow anyone to study or work. Consequently, it was in favour of the
foreign teachers admitting a few of the women to the architecture department. Another
issue was the religion of students (fig. 129-130). One of the former students, Wajeda
Rab writes,
I remember there were three Hindu students in our class who left
for Kolkata, in the aftermath of the war. Suddenly our class size
shrank from about 22 to 19. I heard Prof. Vrooman gave those
three students letter of recommendation to get admitted to Indian
schools of architecture.472
There was mixture of Hindu and Muslim students in the classes, who later needed to
leave for Kolkata in 1965 due to the Indo-Pakistan war. This incident clearly
demonstrates how the religious division was actively involved in every sector in East
Pakistan. Nonetheless, the student body became diverse with time and the entrance
exam known as the ‘design test’ was the only method to select pupils.

For the first few years, the teachers had to teach multiple disciplines as there were a
very limited number of academics. For design classes, several methods were applied.
Vrooman was meticulous and ‘encouraged each student to excel in their
capabilities.’473 Along with his aforementioned book on guidance of colour in
architecture at Texas A&M University, Vrooman also wrote another book on
perspective drawings at EPUET. Additionally, being experienced both in teaching and
practicing, Vrooman was skilled in dealing with all issues related to architecture such
as drafting, designing and construction management.474 Meanwhile, Dunham would

take students outside of the classroom to introduce them to a materialistic approach
in architecture. This included taking the students to one of the first five-star hotels in
Dhaka named Intercontinental to teach them how western hotels and restaurants were
designed and functioned.475 Additionally, Dunham included his students in a
vernacular housing study of the living situation of male labourers in Dhaka.476 This
research enabled the students to be engaged in thinking about ‘actual urban housing
needs and challenges from observing the world around them.’477 There were not many
supplies for drawing or model-making in Dhaka in the early 1960s. As a solution,
Vrooman ordered studio supplies from the USA which would take couple of months to
arrive and a storeroom was arranged to store the finest materials and equipment. In
the meantime, Dunham decided to find local resources for which he went to the
Islampur-Chawkbazar area of Old Dhaka and found regular thin cardboard sheets and
local bookbinders who used boiled flour glue.478 Also, to resolve the issue of modelmaking knives, Dunham went to the Tataribazar blacksmith area and asked them to
make several.

476 Dunham called the shared housing pattern ‘messing’ – a term from British times based on the
military name for a group of men who live and eat together. See, Dunham and Dunham, Some Weep,

Gradually the department started to grow as more teachers were hired to teach other
subjects. In order to distinguish the architecture school from the existing engineering
curriculum, Vrooman and his team decided to include subjects from the humanities
and arts. This would create a diverse environment in which both local and foreign
professors would be teaching together. The Vice Chancellor of the Engineering
University started to take the structure class and more tutors were enlisted under the
USAID programme to join the faculty.479 Mary F. Dunham reminisces that from his
local contacts with foreigners, Daniel Dunham invited a number of scholars to teach
courses such as art history and music appreciation.480 There were some short-term
visiting professors who also covered many subjects, such as, Jaques Koek in
city/regional planning and Edward Romieniec, Robert White and John Exeley in
Landscape Architecture. Roy Vollmer who was working with Louis Kahn at Dhaka
worked as a part-time teacher alongside C. Gustaf Langford and Khadem Ali.481 The
arts and humanities classes were covered by some of the active foreign women
teachers, namely Joan C. Walden, Mary Kay Donaldson, Mary F. Dunham and Ann
W. Werkheiser. There were notable practicing architects who performed visiting
lectures in the department, such as Muzharul Islam, then the president of the Institute
of Architects Pakistan, Paul Rudolph from Yale University, Stanley Tigerman from
Chicago, Angelo Lucia from Michigan, Aptulla Kuran from Middle Eastern Technical
University (METU) and Helmut Borcherdt from Germany. Visiting lectures from these
notable architects provided the students with the vision of real-life and world-wide
architectural trends. Around the same time, Louis I. Kahn was designing the Sher-E-

Bangla Nagar which was the iconic and most ambitious project ongoing in Dhaka. This
massive project enabled the students to witness a landmark construction which was
designed with the methods suited to the local climate by using local materials. This
project also gave opportunities for students to work part-time in Kahn’s office in Dhaka
providing them with valuable experience.

As the department was setting up with admitting students, it sometimes became
difficult when the foreign members of the architectural department faced continuous
political obstacles. As the country was long dependant on foreign assistance (USAID),
the political unrest instigated more hinderance. There were continuous riots and
strikes during the 1960s due to the continuation of the Bengali Language Movement
of the 1950s. Often the teachers would find their classrooms empty as the students
were out on active strikes. The Indo-Pakistan War of 1965 even forced a lot of
foreigners, including the teachers of the architecture department, to evacuate to safe
cities for a while. Walden recalls,
In those early days there was a lot of political turmoil in and
around Dacca. Students at the university where frequently on
strike over some issue or another and this was a periodic
disruption of our teaching efforts. Additionally at some point India
and Pakistan became embroiled in armed conflict and our
families were all evacuated to Manila leaving all the [local] men
to continue our programmes.482

482 Walden, "Memoir: My Dacca Days," 30.

256



Eventually, the goal of creating the architecture department was achieved. The
programme was designed to phase out American teachers and planned to be run by
the local teachers. Thus, by the end of 1968, Vrooman had left Dhaka to continue his
job at the Texas A&M University. The department was fully staffed with a local Dean
and teachers. Shah Alam Zahiruddin was appointed the new Dean whilst Vrooman
would continue working as the Chief Advisor from abroad. Additionally, many students
who had graduated from the first and second year classes of architecture joined the
department as teachers.483 According to Walden’s statement, ‘we were just trying to
start something.’484 The USAID operation was successful in adopting a pedagogical
approach that developed skills to draft, design and construct buildings; and motivated
students to identify local problems and design their own with the basis of local needs.
Sponsored by USAID, the framework of architectural education established by
Vrooman and his team achieved a standard system inseparable from the present
Bangladeshi architectural context.

4.4.3 The First Architectural Department: The Building
Whilst the architecture school was steadily running its course, Vrooman was
requested by the Vice Chancellor of EPUET, Prof Dr M. A. Rashid, to design and
construct the architecture department building and adjoining administration buildings
on the campus (fig. 138).485 Additionally, the Vice Chancellor also requested Dunham
to work on a master plan for the campus in order to assess the ‘growth pattern and

area requirement.’486 Dunham produced a conceptual study of the site plan to evaluate
this growth pattern but this plan was never implemented.487

Meanwhile, Vrooman was handed a site on the west side of the Engineering University
campus which had housings for the Survey School.488 The site was located between
the railway tracks on the south, a street lined with trees on the north and a pond in the
middle (fig. 138).489 Vrooman took the challenge to design and build the architecture
department from the scratch in that he not only considered the form, function and
aesthetics, but also took into account the hot and humid climate by elongating the

488 Islam, "Overhead View," 11.

259



structure in an east-west orientation (fig 135).490 The building became one of most
recognisable built-forms on campus with its ideal modern and tropical characteristics.
The form and mass were honestly expressed with a structural system, materials,
framing and other functional elements.491

An Exclusive Interview with The Delegate," (2015), 2.

As a teacher in the newly-built department, Vrooman planned his building so that it
would not only provide proper functions for the school but would also ‘serve as a
textbook example of how buildings are to be planned, designed and constructed.’492
Islam has compared the Bauhaus Building in Dessau to Vrooman’s design of the
architecture building in Dhaka as the administrative and classroom wings of the two

structures are linked to each other (fig. 139).493 The architecture department building
took some inspiration from the concept of the Bauhaus building as Vrooman designed
each building according to its ‘own scale and identity’ but connected them together.494
Nonetheless, as Nizamuddin Ahmed has argued, the complex also demonstrated a
plaza space that recalls local functionality. The space created by linking the buildings
forms a courtyard which reflects the uthan (courtyard) culture of rural houses of
Bangladesh.495 The main entrance was placed at the junction of the two buildings. The
four-storied classroom wing was bracketed by semi-circular facades on each side
alongside the large circular plant holders (fig. 140). In the classroom building, a strict
structural grid of columns and beams was installed to allow non-bearing internal walls
to divide and lay out the classrooms. The layout of the classrooms and studios was
designed to be functional for both day and night. Alongside the spacious arrangement
of the studios, the exterior louver on each side of the building also assured ‘filtered
sunlight at daytime and [a] view at night.’496 The railing panels were designed with
louvers to provide cross-ventilation as the classrooms were not air-conditioned. The
wide-open deep balconies behind the cast-in-place concrete louvers served as
corridors for the classrooms (fig. 143).497 The adjoining two-storied administrative wing
included staff offices, a library and a double height exhibition space for conducting
juries and displaying models. Vrooman succeeded both as a mentor and a designer
during his project to construct the architecture department (fig. 139). He shared his
drawings and designs for the building with the students and discussed the concepts

After the completion, Vrooman held a meeting forum with his staff and students to
critique the building. One concern was how the building would expand in the future. In
answer to that, Vrooman explained how the structure was designed to expand
vertically.498 One complication which arose was the problem of being able to keep the
circular drop off with the front entrance as the military authorities decided to erect
boundary walls for safety. This discontinued the access from the main street to the
buildings. Eventually, the natural tree-lined street became the backside of the building
and the circular arrival point was never realised. Nonetheless, the building was
aesthetically praised and ideally functioned for its purpose. As Rafique Islam
describes:
To its credit, the building has provided a much needed space for
architecture students and staff away from the stuffy quarters of
the Engineering Department. It has given the department its
distinct identity. Students find studio spaces are very user
friendly and use them day and night. The collaborative nature of
architecture and open flow of ideas are enhanced by such
spaces. Festivals, parties and celebrations are held in the
building and spill out into the courtyard. It is indeed a building to
celebrate and celebrate in. The gift of Mr. Vrooman to the
generations of architects continues to live on an encourage,
educate and enrich.499

In due course, the EPUET staff members grew in numbers including local teachers.
As a government university, the department required faculty housing and student
accommodation. Dunham designed the teachers’ housing for the department. Also,

Walden and Boughey designed more faculty housings and student dormitories on
campus.500

Dunham’s design of the EPUET faculty housing followed a straightforward plan (fig.
144-145). During the design, Dunham was mindful about the local culture and religious
traditions. He studied the future tenants’ household needs and visited different homes
to understand a Bengali family’s daily routine. The apartment layout was flexible to
provide separate spaces for women and servants yet functioned well as a unified
apartment.501 Additionally, Dunham integrated himself with more local domestic
activities such as the idea of hanging wet saris out for drying in the balconies and
windows.502 He was inspired by the colourful pattern of the local saris and decided to
implement the concept in the design of the building facades. Dunham therefore
positioned the balconies on the southern side to enable maximum exposure to air and
light (fig. 147). Furthermore, he ‘spaced the balconies vertically according to the
dimension of a standard sari, so that each sari would hang in its own space without
overlapping the [other] saris from the floors above or below.’503

Boughey, then the Chief Architect of Berger Associates, designed three identical malestudent hostels in the south-western part of EPUET: Titumir Hall, Suhrawardy Hall and
Sher-E-Bangla Hall; all three of the hostels are still functioning in a similar way to the
architecture department building and faculty housing today (fig. 148). The hostels
consist of accommodation, a canteen, common-rooms, and prayer spaces. Each
complex has two indistinguishable residential buildings separately placed. In between
the buildings, there is a canteen block and a common room block with a prayer space.
The residential wings mediated by the two blocks create a courtyard for outdoor
gatherings for students. In a similar way to Vrooman and Dunham, Boughey also
considered the tropical climate by aligning the structure in the east-west axis to provide
exposure from the north and south (fig. 149). The exterior of the residential wings is
transparent as the outer layers serve as balconies and corridors on each side, and the
internal spaces are rooms with windows on both sides. Boughey included shadings
for passive cooling in the corridors which also functioned as an elevated informal
space for student interaction. The residential structure is designed in a symmetrical
order with the staircase at its centre and with a toilet block at the two opposite ends.
Fatema Tasmia observes,
The series of dwelling cells with operable transparent screen-like
window walls are sandwiched with two transparent layers of
semi-outdoor space on both sides, one of which is the common
circulation corridor, and the other is a series of more private
balconies. The residential wings of each hostel block look at the
central courtyard through corridors.504

Despite the dominant horizontality, the building has a well-composed vertical
expression. Boughey rationally designed the exterior façade with climate
consideration by including cantilevered beams (fig. 150). These beams support the
corridor and balconies equipped with linear lintels which ‘adds a dimension in visual
composition.’505 Boughey also designed a series of rainwater downspouts in light of
the heavy monsoon weather of the region (fig. 151). The rainspouts are positioned ‘to
collect the rainwater from the roof and discharge them to the ground through the
vertical concealed shafts.’506 Although Boughey was concerned with the tropical

climate, he also implemented traditional features within his modern building. He used
a jali (perforated) brick screen as a translucent façade for the staircases. The other
two blocks containing canteen and common room were also designed with post-lintel
concrete frameworks with a cantilevered roof (fig. 152).507

All the aforementioned designs involved in the setting up of the architecture buildings
demonstrate Modern architectural features with climatic solutions. Each of the designs
generates a simple rhythm that delineates the modern and rational expressions of
Vrooman, Dunham and Boughey. Considering the climate, all the architects who
worked in East Pakistan wisely implemented specific architectural features in their
designs. These included the orientation of the building, post and lintel construction,
shading devices, rainspouts and porous railings with overhanging balconies.

4.5 Conclusion
The historical and empirical findings in this chapter reveal that the construction of
institutional and public buildings reflected a widespread expression of modernisation
in East Pakistan. Although Ayub Khan had his own vision of nation building in relation
to religion or US alliance, nevertheless, these architects manifested individuality in

272



their designs which was both modern as well as contextual. The buildings examined
in this chapter can be referred to a similar approach of design demonstrated in
Regional or Tropical Architecture which was being constructed in most of the 1960s
postcolonial countries. The designs of the foreign architects in East Pakistan were
indeed introducing Modernism with careful consideration to tradition and climate.
However, the transformation of architecture was perhaps not so much a matter of style
rather it was an altered vision of building a nation that contrasted with Khan’s vision of
nation building.

Doxiadis did not fully implement modernisation, rather he attempted to create an
‘irreconcilable

opposition

between

progressive

democracy

and

regressive

traditionalism.’508 For a fact, in his earlier projects in Pakistan, he was not aware of the
many detailed aspects of the religious and traditional culture of the people. Tigerman
and Islam visited Doxiadis’ housing project in the Old Town of Dhaka.509 According to
Tigerman, the project was compelling with its composition of ‘alternative disposed onestory solid and voids’ but the proportion of courtyard or air flow techniques for building
orientation were non-existent.510 The kitchens and baths were situated on the wind
flow side and the squatting slabs of the toilets faced towards Mecca which was
certainly not respectful to the Muslim society.511 However, in due course, Doxiadis did
acquire knowledge of the native culture and in his later projects, he advocated a hybrid
expression that created a concept of topography with ideal schools, ideal training

institutes, ideal research centres and so forth. The architecture of Doxiadis is an
abstraction of the social and cultural traditions of Bengal combined with modernity.

Amongst all of these architects, Dunham spent the most time in East Pakistan which
led him to experience the culture deeply and it helped him to understand the
requirements the natives needed. Dunham designed his buildings with simple forms
and rational functions, something that was economically sustainable. Indeed his
engagement with the dwellers and his students in the designs for EPUET Faculty
Housing or for Thana Housing that reveal a sincere concern for the opinion of the
natives. The authorities required the Kamalapur Railway Station to be highly Islamic
in form, however Dunham abstracted the required Islamic features and designed the
roof with his ‘dome umbrella scheme.’ The architecture of Dunham offers real and
rational experience in which modernism is used as a tool for sensible design.

In the establishment of the department of architecture, the intention of Vrooman and
his team was to provide Bengali pupils with the basic education of architecture.
However, what they actually achieved was establishing a rigid curriculum for the
students who would be able to identify and conceptualise community predicaments
following the modern trends of solving issues. These notions were been pointed out
by Stanley Tigerman who highlighted how the teachers of the newly established
department of architecture at EPUET (presently BUET) did not involve themselves
with any local architectural educators or practitioners.512 The faculties also designed
and erected their dwellings as Western-style housings and did not engage with the

274



native people.513 Parvin and Moore argue that the modern trends to resolve community
problems that the students were taught in architecture were technological and
decontextualising.514 They also argue that the USAID mission of serving society with
a proposed ‘technology-biased pedagogy’ in fact served the ‘interests of universal,
rational and standardised superstructure.’515 Parvin and Moore’s arguments can be
taken into consideration as the foreign teachers did teach modern design techniques
that would in fact prove contextually futile for East Pakistan. The teaching method
Vrooman and his team conducted was simply from what they knew, however success
was really achieved when the students themselves came to be in charge, filling the
gap of a traditional involvement in architecture. Rafique Islam observes that this was
a humble beginning for architecture in East Pakistan that eventually allowed local
architects to be in the service of their nation without being dependent on Western
countries.516 The architectural pedagogy introduced by Vrooman and his team
produced a new generation of architects who were taught architecture estranged from
the contextual thought and community they were to serve.517 Apparently, both provider
and recipient assumed Western pedagogy to be the natural and neutral form of
knowledge and the ideal doctrine to spread across the world.

The consequences of imported architecture and architectural pedagogy resulted in
two outcomes. Firstly, the source of gaining real experience in design and construction

was through the modern buildings designed by expatriate architects. This method
activated the ‘neo-colonial bias towards the abstraction of modernist architecture,’
which is also significantly a universal concern.518 Secondly, the Western methods of
teaching and curriculum administered a focussed system for architectural education.
However, the focus abetted an academic disconnection from the place, people and
culture of Bangladesh. Even decades later, the newly-founded private and
Government schools of architecture are still based on the BUET curriculum. The
expatriate architects and educators had a very difficult time in East Pakistan due to
ongoing political turbulences. The continuous tension of a raging civil war hindered
their works. Nonetheless, they produced buildings that reflected a new identity for
Bangladeshi architecture and they developed a well-structured practice and teaching
community that provided scope and ambition for the people.

Chapter 5: Architecture of Independence
The previous chapters traced themes and tropes related to Modernism with Bengali
identity and Tropical and Regional architecture that involved the individual or group
endeavours of architects. Particular attention was paid to the emergence and evolving
conceptions of lingual and cultural barriers such as the paradoxical issues of Bangla
and Urdu language during the 1950s. This chapter extends those ideas in a centralised
political setting in which architecture will be discussed in the discourse of
multidisciplinary aspects that include shifts from Modernism to Postmodernism,
dualism of nation-building that resulted in a civil war and a transition of a monumental
structure from a secondary built-form to a nation’s icon. Throughout this section, my
focus will be on the National Assembly Building which is the central structure of the
Capitol Complex of Dhaka, Bangladesh (1962-83) designed by American architect
Louis I. Kahn (1901 – 1974) (fig. 153-154). Ironically, this complex was never intended
to be the capitol for Bangladesh, rather it was meant to be built as the second capitol
for East Pakistan commissioned by President Ayub Khan as a political strategy to
secure his position. In the study of the individual building, the masterplan of the
complex alongside other structural elements will be mentioned, however, the analysis
will remain central to the Assembly Building in order to understand its nuanced and
distinctive narrative. This will reflect Kahn’s attempt to invest monumentality into
architecture amidst a raging political situation that changed not only the purpose of its
creation but also the fate of an independent Bangladesh.

5.1 Introduction
In the history of postcolonial architecture, the National Assembly Building is
considered to be a strong example. Built in a non-Western newly independent context,
this building engages with the turning-point of a nation’s identity and a Western
278



architect’s career. The project encounters cross-cultural disciplinaries in mainly three
sections: East and West; Bangladesh and Pakistan; and Modernism and
Postmodernism. Embedded within these categories, the Assembly Building has been
explored numerous times in scholarly studies, either as an architectural oeuvre of
Kahn, as an instance of American Modernism or as a postcolonial transition to
postmodernism manifested in a new nation. However, what has failed to be explored
is the deeper connotations of this edifice in which the core concern consists of the
relationship between the monument and the city in a cultural setting of dominance and
submission. Drawing attention to recently published research as well as continuing
studies of the National Capitol Complex of Dhaka, this chapter will attempt to unravel
the discursive turbulences and misalignments that shed light on this project from a
broader historical and cross-disciplinary perspective. A key purpose of this analysis is
to develop a framework from existing research in order to understand the relationship
between the National Assembly Building and the political situation it was constructed
in. Most scholarly analyses are vastly focussed on Kahn’s relationship to the complex,
identifying the greatness of his creation or diagnosing its misconnections and flaws.
For example, some scholars have pointed out intense discontinuity between Kahn’s
philosophies

and

the

social,

political

and

environmental

reality

of

East

Pakistan/Bangladesh. Furthermore, the building has been criticised as an ‘orientalist’
stereotype in a postcolonial context. Despite contradictory criticisms, however,
scholars have nevertheless agreed the following: namely that the Capitol Complex
started as a political strategy initiated by President Khan to declare power and control
through space, but it emerged as a site of public gathering symbolising the struggles
of Bengalis for independence. Rather than analysing the design development of the

279



complex, this chapter will explore the design method in relation to the architectural
proposition associated with tradition and highlight the multiple interpretations of the
building within the frame of its historical and philosophical background.

5.1.1 Existing Literature
Research on Kahn and his architecture has been dominated by American scholars
since the 1960s. Bangladeshi scholars meanwhile involved themselves in research
after Kahn was particularly engaged in the Dhaka commission. Focussing on only the
Capitol Complex, both American and Bangladeshi scholars have nevertheless
contributed to the study of Kahn’s architectural masterpiece, providing an opportunity
to explore this building from various horizons. Scholars have researched from two
major perspectives. Firstly, the common theme has been evaluating Kahn’s
understanding of architecture and how he implemented the ideologies and influences
developed throughout his career concentrating on the Capitol Complex despite the
vulnerable context of Pakistan. Although, the context has been mentioned, the study
has always been focussed on Kahn’s architectural journey. This theme is explored by
the majority of Western scholars in contrast to the second theme initiated by
Bangladeshi scholars, who attempted to study the complex within a more vernacular
and political environment, to define the National Assembly Building as a trajectory for
a developing country. Although there are exceptions, not all Western scholars only
explored the building from the perspective of Kahn’s design ideograms; rather some
scholars pursued the edifice from different angles, combining this perception to
demonstrate the Capitol Complex as a functional architectural entity that may- or may

280



not- only be a remarkable structure but also one profoundly intertwined with the
modern architectural and political history of Bangladesh.

The first comprehensive review of Kahn’s architectural career was demonstrated by
Sterling Professor and Art Historian, Vincent Scully from Yale University. Focussing
on selected works by Kahn, Scully’s Louis I. Kahn published in 1962, traced the design
history and development of his key projects.519 In 1966, between 26 April and 30 May,
the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) arranged an exhibition of Kahn’s architectural
works by displaying models, photos and slides. This was one of the earliest public
events to exhibit a three-dimensional model of the National Assembly Building (fig.
155). August E. Komendant, Kahn’s long-time associate as a structural engineer,
published his own experiences and opinions about his colleague in 18 Years with
Louis I. Kahn (1975). Furthermore, the book provides with personal narratives

revealing the environment and situations Kahn was working in during his various
projects.520 Scully established a background for Kahn’s architectural endeavours,
MoMA administered a wider exposure of his works and Komendant demonstrated a
professional attitude with his colleagues. However, the analysis of both Kahn’s built
and unbuilt projects really took up pace in the 1980s, with a new generation of
scholars. During the 1980s, several articles featured the Capitol Complex and
published writings in relation to its background, construction and economic history, as
a part of the urban development of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar (City of the Bengal Tiger).
These articles were written by several of Kahn’s scholars and colleagues, who were
involved in the Dhaka commission and who would subsequently be working either on
other projects in the subcontinent or who were interested in how this complex was
shaping the economy and international status of Bangladesh after independence.521

The National Assembly Building became a profound subject of research in the 1990s
when a two-day symposium was held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) organised, by the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture (AKPIA) in October
1991 (fig. 156).522 Nominated for the Aga Khan Award for Architecture (AKAA) in 1989,

the Capitol Complex prompted some controversial responses that were highlighted in
the symposium, underlining the importance of this building not only as a most
remarkable example of Kahn’s architecture but also as a manifestation of Modernism
in a non-Western region. Assistant Professor of Architecture at the MIT and
symposium coordinator, Francesco Passanti structured the presentations according
to two themes: discussions of how the complex related to Kahn’s larger body of work
and the multicultural qualities that shaped the production of the edifice. Invited
speakers included both American and Bangladeshi scholars who were the second
generation of experts working between the late 1980s and early 1990s on a revised
reflection of Kahn’s architecture and other related disciplines.523

The opening of the Aga Khan symposium was initiated by two professors from the
University of Pennsylvania, David Brownlee and David De Long who demonstrated a
historical overview of Kahn’s early work tracing various influences through classical
architecture, his Beaux Arts education and other formal vocabulary of architecture and the state of affairs of the Dhaka commission was discussed within this context.
Following the presentation, Brownlee and De Long co-curated a major exhibition and
published a monograph, both entitled Louis I. Kahn: In the Realm of Architecture (fig.
157-158).524 The exhibition and the book both demonstrated Kahn’s professional

524 Initially the exhibition was held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and later travelled to Centre
Georges Pompidou in Paris (spring 1992), MoMa in New York (summer 1992), the Museum of
Modern Art of Gunma in Japan (fall 1992), Museum of Contemporary Art (MoCA) in Los Angeles
(spring 1993), Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth (1993) and concluded at Wexner Center for the
Arts at Ohio State University (1993-94). Arata Isozaki designed an installation in the exhibition based

trajectories from an early stage to his mature phase. The Capitol Complex in particular
was regarded as one of Kahn’s mature projects. Drawing references from Scully, who
first advanced Kahn’s sojourn of Europe, Brownlee and De Long explored his
experiences in Rome, Greece and Egypt that consequently influenced the design
development of the National Assembly Building.

Another scholar associated with In the Realm was Peter Reed, who had recently
graduated from the University of Pennsylvania during the exhibition and publication.
Advised by Brownlee, Reed’s PhD dissertation was one of the earliest examples of
doctoral research on Kahn to illustrate a critical study of the architect’s work in relation

285



to its context.525 Reed’s symposium paper ‘Professor Kahn’s Great Game: Building
Dhaka’s National Symbol’ and his essay ‘Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, Capital of
Bangladesh’ featured in In the Realm and represented a sequential analysis of the
Capitol Complex by focussing on Kahn’s conceptual development in which a generic
masterplan was developed and particularised.526 Alongside the tectonic construction
of the building, Reed demonstrated how it was combined with traditional built
strategies and adjusted to local climatic conditions. Furthermore, Reed’s studies
provided new insights into the relationship between Kahn’s architectural firm and the
Public Works Department (PWD) of Pakistan. Despite differences of opinions, Reed’s
research illustrated how the architects and engineers of the PWD developed a great
respect for Kahn and his architectural vision which consequently safeguarded him
from the central Government of Pakistan, and enabled him to further acquire an
exceptional level of architectural freedom. Reed analysed the intertwined events of
political, social and professional relationships that shaped Kahn’s project in Dhaka and
revealed how these permitted the architect unimaginable possibilities for architectural
propositions that had previously only been considered in theories or polemical
debates.

A more precise and detailed political implication of the Capitol Complex is represented
in the scholarship of the urban historian and critic from MIT, namely Lawrence J. Vale.
From cross-disciplinary perspectives, Vale developed a discourse on nationalism and

Philosophy, University of Pennsylvania, 1989).

national identity that explored beyond the field of architectural history. In Architecture,
Power and National Identity (1992), Vale reviewed a range of capitol complexes in
certain capital cities, analysing social values of each of the countries through their
political and architectural networks; the Capitol Complex of Dhaka was a major case
study.527 Vale categorised his case studies from the aspects of political history and
organised them according to their vital functions. For example, the US Capitol in
Washington D. C. demonstrated a legislative function, New Delhi could be seen as
having an executive function and Canberra’s assembly building exhibited a ‘plazacentred’ function. Vale suggested the Dhaka Capitol as having a combination of
legislative and plaza-centred typology. In Vale’s opinion, this hybrid function was a
result of a continuous negotiation between the client’s preference and Kahn’s
romanticised vision for the National Assembly Building. Vale identified misconnections
between the architecture of the Assembly and its socio-political conditions. Vale’s
scepticism regarding the Assembly Building is evident in his letter to the editor of The
Architectural Review, published in 1987. Vale wrote,
The building may have its ‘servant’ and ‘served’ space within it,
but how does it serve Bangladesh? At this point, it still serves as
a reminder of the Pakistani government that commissioned it
and against whom a war was fought. […] The high drama of its
form and high-mindedness of Kahn’s rhetoric stand in contrast
with the weakness of the institution is housed. Ironically, it seems
that monumentality in parliament buildings may be directly
proportional to the fragility of the regime that promotes it.528

287



This was resolutely outlined in the chapter entitled ‘The Acropolis of Bangladesh’ in
Architecture, Power and National Identity, in which Vale implied that Kahn’s
monumentality of ‘transcendent nature,’ his attempt to regionalise an American
Modernist design, his amalgamation of spirituality and secularity and his idealisation
of democracy through public engagement were all based on a personal preoccupation
with architecture and had little involvement with its urban context, people and their
culture. Despite Vale’s detailed criticism of the Capitol Complex, his final verdict
broadly emphasised how the completed project resulted in a successful integration
with its urban and cultural settings, as the southern plaza adjacent to the lake and park
became a popular gathering space within the congested city of Dhaka.

Parallel and competitive analyses related to the National Assembly Building are
demonstrated in a range of doctoral theses. Whilst Reed was developing an analysis
of the complex in his thesis, Sarah Williams Ksiazek’s dissertation was also taking
shape at the Columbia University. Ksiazek’s analysis broadly focussed on Kahn’s
evolving post-war ideas and influence on institutional architecture, and a meticulous
study of the Capitol Complex was one of the main case studies of her research.
Ksiazek’s article published in 1993 entitled ‘Architectural Culture in the Fifties: Louis
Kahn and the National Assembly Complex in Dhaka’ formed a basis for further
exploration of the complex in the concluding chapter of her PhD Dissertation
completed in 1995.529 Afterwards, the thesis was developed and published as a book

entitled Louis Kahn’s Situated Modernism (2001), in which Sarah Williams Goldhagen
demonstrated a radical criticism of the existing scholarship on Kahn, pointing out
several series of claims, flaws and myths and shaping her study by demonstrating
rational aspects through the historical trajectories.530 Goldhagen framed Kahn as an
enthusiastic modernist, illustrating how his social faith was transformed into
architecture. Paying particular attention to the Dhaka Capitol, Goldhagen’s research
largely reflected on Kahn’s previous designs of public buildings and how the former
resemblances were subsequently portrayed in the Assembly Building. For example,
Goldhagen compared the drawings of the National Assembly Building with the plan of
the First Unitarian Church in Rochester and the the interlocking diamond shaped forms
of Erdman Hall Dormitories in Bryn Mawr College and Fisher House in Pennsylvania.
Akin to Brownlee and De Long, Goldhagen also examined the influence which Kahn
took from ancient structures, further expanding the investigation to include his
subcontinental travels in order to explore a connection between the implementation of
East and West. In contrast to Scully’s narrative of Kahn, Goldhagen considered him
simply as an American architect whose designs evolved with his surroundings. In
Goldhagen’s analysis, the Capitol Complex was comprehended as the climax of
Kahn’s career and the project was recognised as a successful American adaptation in
the making of new democratic country.

Whilst previous scholarship in relation to the Capitol Complex of Dhaka explored the
building against a broader study of Kahn’s architecture, it has also been the subject of

a more focussed research for some scholars. Completed in 2013 from the University
of New South Wales, Maryam Gusheh’s PhD dissertation focussed on the complex in
relation to Kahn’s perception of ruins as a design methodology.531 Gusheh argued the
National Assembly Building to be a civic monument and an American proposition in
the shift from modernism to postmodernism, either as an example of neo-colonial
practice or as an expression of Bangladeshi modernism. Alongside a critical
engagement with Scully’s writings, Gusheh demonstrated a close reading of other
recent scholars, underlining a subtle transition in design strategies from one cultural
setting to another. Gusheh’s analysis developed in three broader areas of research:
critical revision of Kahn’s architecture before the Dhaka commission, the relationship
between the urban context and the complex; and the connection between ‘centre and
periphery’ as a mediation of architectural threshold.532 Gusheh’s interpretation of the
Capitol Complex through the study of ruins synthesised multidisciplinary subject areas
with political and architectural analysis.

The Capitol Complex was constructed in a way that it can be perceived according to
diverse architectural interpretations. On the one hand, Gusheh’s thesis unravels the
complex from a viewpoint of ruins and on the other hand, Labib Hossain’s investigation
seeks out the connection between the landscape and the Assembly Building. Hossain,
a doctorate fellow from Cornell University, is currently researching the landscape
architecture of the Capitol Complex specifically in relation to the waterbody that was
designed considering Bengali monsoon weather and the floods this can cause. In his

290



recent article published in the edited book entitled Rethinking Global Modernism:
Architectural Historiography and the Postcolonial (2022), Hossain explores Kahn’s
various inspirations from his travels around India and East and West Pakistan during
his commission of the complex.533 He deliberately focuses on two aspects of Kahn’s
inspiration – nature and the ruins. By examining Kahn’s sketches of boats and
waterbodies when he travelled to the Buriganga river of Dhaka, Hossain argues that
the former are devoid of human presence, revealing instead an ‘obsession with floating
forms’ which are isolated from the surrounding nature.534 In Pundranagar to Sher-EBangla Nagar: Architecture in Bangladesh published in 1997, Ashraf and Haque claim
that the Assembly Building’s monumental expression was inspired by the eighth
century Paharpur Buddhist Complex situated at Naogaon; Hossain however argues
that there is no evidence that Kahn ever visited the northern part of East Bengal.535 In
a documentary created by Art Historian Sundaram Tagore (2019), it is implied that
Kahn might have been inspired by the postcards of the Paharpur Complex which he
apperantly sent to his associate Pattinson.536

Contrary to the theses of Goldhagen, Gusheh and Hossain, which observe the Capitol
Complex from diverse architectural dimensions, Bayezid Ismail Choudhury’s PhD
dissertation positions the National Assembly Building in a paradoxical cultural setting

incorporating local and global politics. Completed in 2015 from the University of
Sydney, Choudhury’s thesis explores the deeper sentimental values related to East
Bengal, East Pakistan and Bangladesh that connect architecture with a wider ranger
of issues rather than focussing on the spatial qualities of the Assembly Building.537
Developing his thesis through several published articles, Choudhury has unfolded a
subjective meaning to the Assembly Building derived from several aspects related to
the following: Bengali social values and national identity, the ethical approach of the
client and architect and the relationship between the United States and Pakistan,
involving enormous funding during both global and local ongoing coldwars.538
Choudhury’s analysis provides a new insight into the socio-political dilemma in the
spatiality of the National Assembly Building by investigating it from a different angle
that considers Kahn’s idealisations secondary; this is in contrast to other scholars have
argued about the complex. In a similar way to Choudhury, Bangladeshi architect and
scholar, Meer Mobashsher Ali has also analysed the relationship between the National
Assembly Building and the city of Dhaka, principally in his book Shamatate Shangshad
published in 2006. Ali suggests that the rapid urban change of Dhaka is a
consequence of its long political history of shifting power and that the National

Assembly Building provided an opportunity to emerge as an iconic emblem creating
an identity climax in independent Bangladesh.539

5.1.2 Chapter Argument
Despite the Capitol Complex having been studied from numerous different and diverse
perspectives, few research have in fact focussed on how self-evaluation of
Bangladeshi national identity connects to the Assembly Building. Therefore, the
questions remain: How does this building represent as an ‘architecture of
independence’ when it was indented to be built in order to unify the two wings of
Pakistan? How was it decided that it would become a national symbol of Bangladesh?
How did the National Assembly Complex generate a value of identity when it was reused by the Government of Bangladesh as their own iconic symbol? Does this not
contradict the moment when the construction started, and thousands of people
chanted ‘Long live Ayub Khan’ or ‘Pakistan Zindabad?’ Is there any indignity attached
to it as the building was funded by the government against whom the civil war was
fought? And what does it reveal about the relationship between the American
modernism and its non-western context? Rather than seeking to provide direct
answers to the aforementioned questions, this chapter aims to provide a better
understanding of the spatial representation of the National Assembly Building which
was built in a culture enduring a duality of identity. There are some bipolarities related
to both its construction and context that complicate the connection between the
architecture and its function as an institution. In this chapter, I demonstrate this

architectural ambiguity through political and design-related historiographical
narratives. I will attempt to understand the development of the Capitol Complex as it
emerged as a national icon for Bangladesh within existing paradigms of political
instability and a civil war.

5.2 Architecture and Power
Despite the grandeur, it is important to remember that a legislature building is not only
about design, concept and art, but also about authority, power and other social
issues.540 The history of constructing the Capitol Complex also deals with these
phenomena. Whilst the edifice surrounding the hostels is one of the most remarkable
of Kahn’s project, nonetheless, it was also supposed to be one of the most important
works for its client, President Ayub Khan. As much as Kahn’s concepts and intentions
were interwoven in the creation of this complex, Khan’s prudent motive must also be
considered. In their article entitled ‘The Engagement of Kahn and Khan in Jatio
Shangshad Bhaban,’ Choudhury and Graham Bell attempt to understand these two
actors’ rationale according to Adam Smith’s The Theory of Moral Sentiments
(1759).541 They examine the National Assembly Building from the ethical perception
of both client and architect in two categories from Smith’s theory: self-love and
prudence. On the one hand, for Khan, who rose from being ‘supreme commander’ to
self-proclaimed President of Pakistan, building a second capitol was an important
agenda to maintain his political power. On the other hand, for Kahn, it was an
opportunity to exercise his deeper concepts through architecture with the hopes of

getting international recognition by working in a foreign land. Both Khan and Kahn
were sitting on a risky throne and were not without prurient self-interest, paradoxically
creating what is now known as one of the iconic buildings of late twentieth century.
This segment will attempt to analyse Kahn and Khan related to the complex in order
to understand their motives and approach towards the creation of the National
Assembly Building. The main two protagonists are definitely client and architect,
however, they will be explored through others associated with the project either as a
mediators or as associates.

5.2.1 The Client and The Architect
Whilst Kahn was dealing with the frustration of being dismissed by the Foreign
Buildings Operations (FBO) from the design of the US consulate at Luanda, Angola in
1959, he received two important commissions in the Indian subcontinent. First, the
representatives of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in Ahmedabad contacted
Kahn to ask him to design a graduate school of business administration on 6 June
1962. Within less than three months, Kahn received a telegram from the PWD of
Pakistan with an offer to design a legislative building as a second capitol for East
Pakistan on 27 August.542 Despite these sites being located halfway around the world,
Kahn knew that these new commissions were a turning point for his career. Kahn
perceived that architecture would ‘go beyond the limitations imposed by individual

542 Kahn made a major achievement in the community of American architecture by early 1962 with the
designs of the Trenton Bathhouse in New Jersey (1959-), Richards Medical Research Laboratories in
Philadelphia (1957-1965) and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California (19591965). These successes increased the number of commissions as well as the load on his firm. Just
after expanding his office to have adequate space for new projects on the top two floors of a building
located in downtown Philadelphia, Kahn received these two important commissions. See, Carter
Wiseman, Louis I. Kahn: Beyond Time and Style (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2007), 136.

buildings.’543 For the second Capitol Complex of Pakistan, Kahn foresaw to ‘change
the world,’ an ideology he shared in his youth with his friends and later associates,
Oscar Stonorov and George Howe.544

With the opportunity to design this complex, Kahn’s long exploration for a new
modernity transforming ‘monumentality into a symbolic vehicle’ came into a reality that
associated with the community as well as manifesting an authenticity connecting with
the individual self.545 In the respective years, he worked tirelessly to complete two
major parts of the Capitol Complex, the Assembly Building and the adjacent hostels.546
Kahn produced more 10,000 conceptual sketches and drawings and envisioned the
complex to such a scale that the design process and construction continued for
seventeen years, finally being completed in 1983.547 This was nine years after Kahn’s
death in 1974 and almost a decade after the civil war between the two wings of
Pakistan and East Pakistan renamed as Bangladesh.

Ayub Khan, the military dictator of Pakistan found himself in a more intense political
situation. As Pakistan suffered a series of unfortunate political events from the

543 Wiseman, Louis I. Kahn: Beyond Time and Style, 137.
544 Kahn’s aspirations to design for democratic life was evident either it is a city hall, a civic centre or a
parliament building. He believed that all institutions were constructed by government was for common
citizens. These beliefs made Kahn yearn to work on a governmental institution for years. Kahn’s
yearning for being involved in a governmental project or his belief to design a vibrant public space

beginning of its creation, the seat of government changed three times: from Karachi
(1947–1958) to Rawalpindi (1958–1962) and then finally in Islamabad; all cities
located in West Pakistan. The western part of the country received multiple
advantages whereas East Pakistan was less privileged and did not even hold a seat
of active government. Political circumstances started to change when Khan seized
power from Iskander Mirza in 1958, imposed martial law and declared himself as the
Supreme Commander.548 From 1960, under continuing martial law, Khan ran the
country in collaboration with small elite groups and had full control of the parliament.
His reign made little or no differences on East Pakistan apart from some of the
developments from the Basic Democracies which were also helping to keep his
political position. Despite the economic and cultural discrimination, Khan always
aimed to keep the two wings of Pakistan united. As tensions were growing from East
Pakistan, Khan set up a committee consisting of members from both East and West
Pakistan to develop a constitution that would benefit the entire country.

On 8 June 1962, President Khan introduced a new constitution for Pakistan. The
National Assembly met its first session at Ayub Hall in Rawalpindi. Khan announced
that after almost forty-four months the martial law has been terminated. The
Constitution of 1962 was prepared and reviewed for approximately two years and
presented in the assembly as a progressive framework for both wings of the country.
Urdu and Bangla both were recognised as national languages and each wing would
have a provincial government run by a governor. The most distinctive feature of the
1962 Constitution was the presidential re-election which would come into effect after

548 Ziring, The Ayub Khan Era: Politics in Pakistan, 1958-1969.

the current president completes his five-year term of presidency. Therefore, Khan’s
presidency for five-years started from 1960 and mandated that the first democratic
election of Pakistan would be held in 1965. It is surprising that the then ‘supreme
commander’ Khan agreed for a democratic re-election. However, it is assumed that
Khan knew that the presidential form of government could ensure a united Pakistan
and there should be no tampering with the features of the constitution. However, this
event made Khan concerned for his own re-election because he knew that his victory
was dependent upon East Pakistani voters as the majority of the Pakistani population
resided in that territory.

Grinceri argues that ‘politics involves the social management of a population, whereby
certain practices like health, law and education are passed to government who
presume to act in the interests of the people.’549 These objectives are associated with
certain representative tools such as institutions and architecture in order to ‘portray,
represent and preserve an imagined sense of identity.’550 In order to fulfil these
objectives, a government does not necessarily need to force upon these actions,
however, these representative forms produce values or systems of belief which act as
a product of trust for the people. Similarly, to secure his political position for the future
and to convince the people of East Pakistan of his concern about their well-being,
Khan decided that alongside Islamabad, there should also be a National Assembly in
the capital of East Pakistan, in which meetings would take place twice a year.551 There

were ongoing development projects as well as a few governmental buildings inherited
from the British period in Dhaka, but no buildings could house an assembly chamber
of parliamentary proceedings.552 Thus Khan decided to build a grand governmental
complex hoping that the people of East Pakistan would repay him with their votes after
witnessing a large expenditure on a monumental edifice constructed solely for them.553
Thus the commissioning of the Capitol Complex in Dhaka was an election stunt in
which Khan only thought of his own political benefit.

5.2.2 The Mediator
After Khan made the decision to build the second Capitol Complex in Dhaka, his
employees from the PWD initially approached Muzharul Islam for the job as he was
the only local practicing architect.554 Islam was aware of the Islamic identity politicism
and was more engaged in promoting cultural and secular styles in his architecture
(discussed in Chapter 3). Therefore, Islam sought for a positive and effective solution
in building the capitol. Knowing that the designs of Le Corbusier in Chandigarh were
having a great impact on India from the international architectural community, Islam
hoped that ‘his own country should have a comparable monument to help establish its
new status in the world.’555 Thus he would propose to Khan and the PWD authority
that they should give the commission to an architect of an international standard.
Islam’s decision to involve an international architect was not appreciated by the
Pakistani governmental officials. A lot of time was lost in negotiating on which foreign

299



architects they should approach and how the commission would be handed over.
However, Islam was committed on his decision and when Khan reluctantly agreed he
recommended three major western practitioners: Corbusier, Alvar Aalto and Kahn.556
All three of them were telegrammed by the PWD with an offer to design the second
Capitol Complex of Pakistan. Corbusier declined immediately as he was already
occupied with the design for the masterplan and capitol buildings of Chandigarh. Aalto
became sick.557 Therefore, Kahn received the opportunity by default which he also
accepted swiftly. Kahn was agreed to be paid approximately six times more than what
Islam would have been remunerated as a local architect.558 Nevertheless, Islam was
so determined that this important project should be done by Kahn that he even turned
down the opportunity to be the local supervisor when he was asked by the
government, despite knowing he would be the most capable for this job.559

As Kahn was hired as the principal architect, the PWD appointed a Western-trained
West Pakistani namely Kafiluddin Ahmad as the chief engineer for the project, who
would locally supervise the design and construction of the project.560 Ahmad, who
developed a great respect for Kahn, continuously overlooked the latter’s reluctancy for
deadlines and schedules. Amidst these situations, as the project progressed, on the
one hand, Kahn gained more control and his process of developing a design was

557 See, Goldhagen, Louis Kahn’s Situated Modernism, 164. There are verbal anecdotes that Aalto
might have accepted the offer. However, before the day of his flight, he drank heavily and missed his
plane. Information was given in, Tagore, "Louis Kahn’s Tiger City."

slow.561 On the other hand, as the election year was closer, Khan became desperate
to commence the construction. This was evident in Duncan Buell’s telegram to Kahn
in the late 1963, in which he mentioned that Khan has demanded to Ahmad to ‘start
anything – build a shed.’562 The client-architect relationship can be understood
distinctly from the letter Roy Vollmer sent to Kahn from Dhaka:
We’ve got a real political bull by the tail […] right now they
couldn’t be happier if we told them to build a ladder to the moon
and hang the cost. Kafiluddin told me confidentially that he will
spend as much money as he must, disregarding the budget. He
will justify it by having buildings to show.563
This was Kahn’s most unusual commission in which the client did not care about the
design or character of the project he was investing in. Furthermore, Khan never
mentioned about the second Capitol Complex in his long self-congratulatory
autobiography.564 Yet the architect of the complex had access to ample and unlimited
funding with a freedom to design anything on an enormous site. Such unique
circumstances allowed Kahn to explore his abilities in a broader range and to design
the complex with both creative and economic freedom.565

5.2.3 The Sojourns
Before the Dhaka commission, Kahn had already travelled to India in the summer of
1962 to design the IIM in Ahmedabad (1962 – 1974). Subsequently, Kahn’s travels to

561 Kahn was known for his dilatoriness in work. It is assumed that due to his slow process in design
development, he was removed from the Angola project.

the subcontinent were frequent as he accepted a number of commissions that included
the Capitol Complex in Dhaka, the presidential complex in Islamabad which was
rejected by the Pakistani government and the Family Planning Services (1970 – 1975)
in Kathmandu, Nepal which was partially completed. Kahn would travel extensively on
some of his trips. He developed friendships with many architects from the
subcontinent, most prominent amongst them being Balkrishna Doshi and Muzharul
Islam. To understand the local condition, Kahn was assisted by them during his visits
to India and Pakistan in 1962 and 1963 respectively. In November 1962, when Kahn
first travelled to India to visit the site of IIM, he also went to visit the complexes of
Chandigarh designed by Corbusier as these buildings were most esteemed during
that era. Wiseman acknowledges that Kahn had been both fascinated and haunted by
Corbusier since he was a resident in the American Academy in Rome (1950-1951)
and considered the Swiss-French architect an idol.566 After visiting Chandigarh, Kahn
described Corbusier’s work as ‘beautiful’ but also ‘out of context’ to the radio
broadcaster of the US namely Voice of America.567 By studying Corbusier’s work,
Kahn might have considered to design and build something which would complement
the context. Despite his strong motive to develop something unique, Kahn was aware
that it had to be expressive in an accessible and acceptable language not only for his
clients but also for the people who would be the users of the buildings.

Kahn also made extensive visits to the Mughal palaces, forts and mausoleums of
Pakistan and northern India. Kahn was intrigued with the orientation and positioning

567 Quoted in, Wiseman, Louis I. Kahn: Beyond Time and Style, 138.

302



of the structures in the Mughal forts of Lahore. He also travelled to India with his chief
site architect Carles Vallhonrat to explore Mughal complexes in Jaipur, New Delhi and
Fatehpur Sikri.568 Islam introduced Kahn to the deeper sub-culture of Bengal which
was different from Pakistan when he first visited the region in late January 1963 and
stayed for six days.569 Islam made sure that Kahn received a good knowledge of
Bengali local cultures, settlements and the environment in which they travelled by
motorcars, boats and on some occasions by helicopter.570 In these tours with Islam,
Kahn was acquainted with Mughal structures in Dhaka such as the Lalbagh Fort, the
river-based ways of the deltaic regions and Bengali ethnicities which were different
from West Pakistan. Kahn was guided by Islam about the local construction
techniques of a sea-level country that experienced hot and humid weather half of the
year with the another half being monsoon season. According to many sources, Islam
was instrumental in Kahn’s design development as they became friends and would
discuss the complex over a cup of tea; this included details of the Mughal style of
outdoor gathering spaces, central structures within a symmetric landscape and the
idea of Dhaka’s colourful and cacophonous Old Town.571 Goldhagen observed that
these visits had a large impact on Kahn, not only changing the architectural language
for him, but also his manner of locution.572 These travels allowed Kahn to consider
both the climate and religion of Bengal territory and West Pakistani culture.

5.2.4 The Dilemma of the Other Capitol
In contrast to Kahn’s visits with Islam, his meeting with the Pakistani Government was
not promising. Alongside the Dhaka commission, Khan asked Kahn to design his
presidential palace and an assembly building in Islamabad which had to make an
Islamic statement with its architectural features. Kahn initially accepted the offer and
provided a masterplan in which he deliberately ignored the Islamic concepts (fig. 159160).573 Kahn wrote, ‘the insistence of Islamic touch is plaguing.’574 Eventually Kahn
was withdrawn from the Islamabad project leaving him only with the Dhaka
commission. Some of Kahn’s associates criticised him for not understanding what was
required for the Islamabad project, possibly because he was Jewish.575 Nevertheless,
the conflict stemmed not from Kahn’s personal religion, but rather what religion Khan
wanted to imprint on the identity of the nation. For an instance, the assembly and
presidential complex of Islamabad required a strict Islamic appearance, in contrast to
the Dhaka Capitol in which President Khan himself instructed to ‘build a shed.’ Despite
being first and second capital of ‘one’ country, Islamabad was matter of religious
concern, but Dhaka was not. Eventually in 1966, the Islamabad project was
commissioned to Edward Durell Stone, who dedicatedly designed a complex
consisted of a presidential palace and an assembly building with domes and pointed
arches. This demonstrated emulated Islamic identity, however it did not manifest any
iconic national image for a country (fig. 161-162).576

Similar to the Islamabad project, the higher officials and bureaucrats of Pakistan
offered Kahn different opinions of Islamic architectural features for the Dhaka
Complex. However, as Wares recalls, Kahn had Islam as a skilled protector, who was
not only a trained architect but also an activist, who was continuously designing his
buildings relating to Bengali identity.577 Wiseman notes, ‘Islam shielded Kahn from the
bureaucrats and insisted that the architect be left alone to develop the Dhaka design
without [any] sort of interference he had suffered in Islamabad.’578 Furthermore, as the
project was in East Pakistan, the pressure from the central government was also less
intense. But Islam could not avoid the larger political agenda of Khan in which ‘the
government must have communicated the message clearly to the architect to do
everything at monumental scale, as an eyewash. The scale was conceived to impress
the people of Eastern Pakistan that the big brothers of the West care and have great
plans for them.’579 Despite the political manoeuvring, everyone who were involved in
the design and construction of the complex was well-managed by Ahmad resulting in
the project’s progress.

5.3 Monumentalism, Religion and Architecture
Designing a building for a national government is not only associated with architecture
but also the scale of the structure represents the power of the political authority.580
The location of a Capitol Complex is positioned in relation to the neighbouring
environment as well as in connection to the city and the country as a whole.581 The
emplacement of an Assembly Building is an ‘exercise in political power, a spatial
declaration of political control.’582 Kahn was commissioned to design an explicit
political group of buildings. These buildings were required to be arranged not only to
house the Pakistani Government, but also needed to consider the religion that built
the nation. The National Assembly Building displays strong connections to four
elements: firstly, emplacing a gigantic structure as a ‘transcendent object’ to depict
monumentalism; secondly, an exaggerated attempt in an ever evolving masterplan to
connect the mosque and the assembly building in a society where the role of Islam
(as religion) was disputable (discussed in Chapter 2); thirdly, the climate
considerations that were partially in effect to achieve the monumentality; and lastly,
the inconsistency of democracy in a political context which was shaping its
development. Rather than diving into various details of the architectural process, this
segment will attempt to analyse the National Assembly Building from a broader
perspective relating to these connections.

5.3.1 Placing the Citadels
The initial programme for the complex suggested by the PWD was ambiguous. There
are two interpretations of the programme brief. Firstly, numerous writings on the
complex and Kahn himself mentioned that he was advised to design a masterplan that
would include offices and housing for assembly members, ministers and secretaries;
residences for the president, the speakers and the secretary of the assembly; an
assembly building and a mosque. The programme extended demanding a hotel for
the state officials.583 Secondly, Vale referred to his interview with former Chief
Architect of Bangladesh, namely Abul Bashar, who stated that initially ‘Kahn was not
given a written programme at all.’584 Vale cross-checked and found that the only
programme brief ever written is placed in an undated file at Louis I. Kahn Collection in
the University of Pennsylvania. However, it seemed to be written after Kahn had
already begun to work on the project. Analysing the two interpretations, it can be
assumed that Kahn may not have received any initial programme list when he was
being telegrammed with the offer of the commission. Perhaps, the briefing might have
been an on-site discussion Kahn had with the PWD when he travelled to Dhaka for
the first time. Kahn was taken for a site survey which revealed a spacious and flat
terrain and situated near a military airport in the outskirts of the city. The site included
with a small agricultural school and a minor brickmaking plant.585 Emphasises was
given to the religious facilities which needed to be accessible from the parliament for
daytime prayers. The requirements for the residences were also comprehensive as

most of the members of the parliament were expected to be travelling from West
Pakistan and would therefore needing accommodations during legislative sessions.
Alongside the principal programme, Kahn was also asked to develop a masterplan for
the entire site which was approximately between 800 and 1,000 acres. Within this
ample amount of land, the government initially planned to build a Supreme Court,
offices, residences, markets, schools, a hospital, a library, a museum, and recreational
areas for the public.586

The commission required the design of a city within a city, as Goldhagen described it,
as Kahn’s attempt to feel ‘a world within a world.’587 Kahn assessed that the second
Capitol Complex would have three spectators: the international architectural
community, the PWD of Pakistan and the dwellers of Dhaka city. With an aim to create
a design that could communicate with all three, Kahn developed his design
harmonising ruins and past structures of Europe and the Indian subcontinent, securing
a place between both cultures of east and west. He immediately rearranged the
programmes that were given to him by the PWD and divided these into two zones:
‘Citadel of Assembly’ included the Assembly, Supreme Court, mosque and residences
of the president and higher officials; and ‘Citadel of Institutions’ included public,
commercial and recreational functions (fig. 163-164). The scale he chose for the
Citadel of Assembly was so enormous that some of Kahn’s early sketches and
perspectives depict humans as mere dots (fig. 165). For the Citadel of Assembly Kahn

had to make a decision about how to merge the Supreme Court and the mosque with
the position of the Assembly. The 1962 Constitution did not place as much emphasise
on the Supreme Court as it did for the Assembly Building. Therefore, for Kahn’s
notions of transcendence were focussed on the Assembly Building and the Supreme
Court was given secondary importance.

Assembly with a dot depicting human scale in between the mosque’s minaret and the Assembly Building.

In the site plan of 12 March 1963, the Supreme Court, the Assembly Building and the
mosque were placed on the same axis to emphasise on the importance of these
institutions (fig. 166). However, as Vale disputes, ‘the justice was interested in
maintaining a social as well as spatial distance,’ which was evident in the conversation
between Kahn and the Chief Justice of Pakistan when they met to discuss the design
of the Supreme Court within the complex.588 The Chief Justice made it very clear to
Kahn that he did not want his institution near the assembly.589 Thus over a period of

time, there were multiple transformations in the masterplan (fig. 167-168). Kahn’s idea
of having an insulated mosque within the court and assembly was revoked by adding
the mosque into the assembly in the site plan of 10 May 1964 (fig. 169). Within a year,
by February 1965, the axis remained only for the Assembly Building with an adjacent
prayer hall and the Supreme Court building was shifted to one side. (fig. 170)
Eventually in January 1973, the final published version of the masterplan shows Kahn
having placed the Supreme Court behind the Secretariat Complex which neither
connected with the axis nor with the assembly functions (fig. 171). To this date, the
Supreme Court remained unbuilt, as the independent Bangladesh decided to use a
previously existing building which was centrally located in the city. Furthermore, the
secretariat and the civil sector of the masterplan, which Kahn planned as the Citadel
of Institutions were never realised. The dramatic divisions of the Capitol Complex were
subverted and the Citadel of Assembly as it stands today only can be seen, as Vale
labels it, as ‘a Citadel of Bureaucracy.’590

Ali and Vale both investigated why exactly Kahn chose to name his zonal divisions as
‘citadel’; it is unclear as the word has no connotations with either ‘assembly’ or
‘capitol.’591 On the contrary, ‘citadel’ has been often associated with either from the
structures of monarchy or autocratic societies. Then, why would Kahn choose to build
an association with such concepts, especially, when his commission was initiated from
the growing political turbulence? Was he trying to capitalise on the tensions of his
client by providing a greater view of the society with his ideas of democracy? Or was
he just implementing his personal interests in a place where he was given an
opportunity of utter freedom both creatively and financially? Goldhagen has argued
that Kahn sought to create an institution that ‘evoked a “sense of loyalty,” a sense of
the “inevitable responsibility” of “civic living,” to encourage free individuals to

Identity, 270.

316



participate actively in self-governance.’592 This demonstration initiated from what Kahn
expressed as ‘they need things they never knew they needed.’593 He did not even
deny that the ‘needs’ may be expensive and modestly stated that his Dhaka complex
‘cost more because I reveal the truth in those buildings.’594 But, what truth was Kahn
trying to reveal through a second capitol for a country and one which was meant to be
used only two times a year? Being aware of the civil war situations, how did Kahn
anticipate the actual usage of his edifice? In any case, Kahn’s attempt to achieve an
expression of ‘a world within a world’ is undeniably evident in the National Assembly
Building which separates itself from the rest of the city.

5.3.2 Form, Design and Monumentalism
Kahn’s design process was highly personalised beginning with ‘form’ and developing
with ‘what the building wants to be.’ Only after Kahn sensed an essence of a form, he
would proceed with his design. He viewed ‘form and design’ as an interplay of
‘constant excitement of architecture.’595 In the case of National Assembly Building, the
process of developing form was a point of departure rather than the programme itself.
Vale argues that even Kahn claimed his inevitable choice of form, a design
methodology for such huge building, was concerned with ‘a great deal of latitude for
idiosyncrasy and intuition.’596 Vale continued to dispute that Kahn was willing to allow

diverse programme into his ‘form’ when the client wanted it. But Kahn remained
particularly adamant in his concepts, noting,
What I’m trying to do is establish a belief out of a philosophy I
can turn over to Pakistan, so that whatever they do is always
answerable to it. I feel as though this plan which was made
weeks after I saw the program has strength. Does it have all the
ingredients? If only one is lacking, it will disintegrate.597
Whichever philosophy Kahn devised, the basis was focussed on the idea of starting
with an architecture of ‘transcendent nature’ that developed in an attempt to achieve
monumentality, motivating people to act as members of a collective community.598 In
his essay entitled ‘Monumentality’ published in 1944, Kahn defined monumentalism
by exemplifying the Parthenon and how it conveyed eternal feelings for him, stating
that the future of Greek civilisation looked upon the greatness of this temple.599 He
had carried these ideas with himself since 1944 and now attempted to incorporate
these in the production of the National Assembly Building, creating a monument on
which a future civilisation could rely. Not only the masterplan, but also the detailed
plan, scale, massing and spatial sequences of functions were designed by keeping
these conceptions in mind.

As a matter of fact, Kahn wanted many things from one of his most important
commissions. He wanted the assembly to be of ‘transcendent nature,’ he wanted the

form to flow with ‘what the building wants to be’ and he wanted these to be confirmed
and enhanced by his architecture alongside conjectured social ideals of democracy.
In the end, he kept claiming he designed the complex following all these notions.
Kahn’s clarity with words, as Vale argues, rarely matches the finished and realised
forms. This raises confusion in ‘architectural methodology, metaphysical ideals and
social realities.’600 Vale disputes that Kahn’s ‘verbal trickery’ can be useful to develop
a concept, however, undoubtedly he was designing for a society and a culture
completely different from his own. Similarly, Goldhagen argues on how Kahn’s
‘incantatory phrasings’ betray the other concerns of communal life.601 For example,
Kahn proposed two massive plazas located at the north and south entrances of the
National Assembly Building (fig. 172). These ample areas were named South Plaza
and the Presidential Square. The South Plaza is still known to be the largest paved
area in Bangladesh, as Kahn envisioned it not only as an axis for the main building,
but also as a public gathering space. The Presidential Square was proposed as a large
one-storied plinth with an amphitheatre for outdoor events. The plinth is supported by
brick arches generating a cool and shadowed space ‘dominated by irregular [and]
rhythmic vistas’ (fig. 173).602 Kahn designed these plazas with the congregation of
citizens in mind, in contrast to the PWD’s opinion of having a building with limited
access. Kahn contended that this type of plaza could be ‘used very well as a museum
of independence’ or ‘for marshalling ceremonial parades.’603 As a result, these
proposed plazas covering areas of more than 800,000 square feet were, as

Goldhagen criticised, ‘unprogrammed, unrequested and in functional terms –
unnecessary public space.’604 At any cost, Kahn sought to ‘reinforce’ the
monumentality that he claimed as a design technique from the ancient structures.

The ideas initially implemented in the Capitol Complex can be perceived alongside
Western-derived concepts such as modern forms, central plans and an imposed
democratic culture. At first, with his Western tradition and training in Beaux Arts
education, Kahn developed an appreciation for centralised buildings. This admiration
was amplified when Kahn travelled to Europe and explored ancient ruins and
structures. From the early masterplan and initial sketches, Goldhagen describes the
complex as an ‘Versailles-like axes sweeping toward the climactic capitol, separated
from the city and reflected in shallow pools’ (fig. 169).605 Curtis observes that the
classical inspirations were so embedded in Kahn’s mind that it was difficult to single
out each of the applications.606 On the one hand, Curtis claims that Kahn’s exterior
geometry to be similar to the works of Boullée and Ledoux and on the other, Wiseman
emphasises the scale of the National Assembly Building as evoked from sketches of
Piranesi, whose drawings Kahn greatly admired (fig. 174).607 The Beaux Arts tradition
had a huge impact on Kahn’s design as he directly separated his design spaces
between what he described as ‘servant’ and ‘served’ spaces. Furthermore, ceremonial
axes usage is noticeable throughout and the diagonality demonstrated is almost a

homage to the baroque.608 Kahn’s vision of grandeur and massiveness for the complex
led him to refer overall to the scale of Hagia Sophia and to the Pantheon for the central
chamber’s lightwell and the Baths of Caracalla for the masterplan.609

Gusheh argues that Kahn attempted to introduce an American Modernism in the
Eastern countries such as Ahmedabad and Dhaka.610 In contrast, Goldhagen argues
that Kahn’s concepts were neither unique to American characteristics, nor familiar to
Pakistan.611 Perhaps most of Kahn’s conceptions do indeed reveal a European
attitude. However, alongside the European influences, Kahn advanced his design by
combining local traditions as he kept acknowledging that the complex must serve the
local place and culture. He attempted to sculpt his design to favour the climate and to
the architectural tradition of the Indian subcontinent. His initial central planning of the
National Assembly Building echoed the Mughal complexes. Similar to the Taj Mahal
in Agra, the National Assembly Building is elevated centrally on an immense platform
reflected in the artificial lake (fig. 175). Kahn included the waterbody to be reminiscent
of the river-based East Bengal. Goldhagen notes, ‘in doing so, he built in a language
that was locally comprehensible while remaining modern, laying the ground for citizens
to appropriate the complex as an instantiation of their own highest ideals.’612 Western
classical inspiration from historic monuments was the focus of Kahn’s early sketches,
which were extremely abstract. These abstract sketches would help him develop a
design in which to integrate his ideas with their own strong identity.613 The early site
plans of the Salk Institute, for example, resemble Hadrian’s Villa, whereas the final
plans do not. Similarly, in the design for National Assembly Building, Kahn abstracted
his ideas not only from what he knew already, but also from what he had learned from
the Mughal and Bengali vernacular architecture whilst travelling across Indian

subcontinent.614 Thus Kahn developed his designs from Western concepts which he
concocted with various themes common to the East.

The National Assembly Building not only exhibits references to ancient structures of
both East and West, but also has similarity to Kahn’s previous works.615 Goldhagen
argues that Kahn’s democratic ideas in his architecture were initiated through his
former design of the Unitarian Church in Rochester. A thorough analysis conducted
by Goldhagen demonstrates how Kahn’s ideology of democracy had been attempted
to be implemented in the design of the Unitarian Church, which was extensively
explored later in the design of the National Assembly Building. Moreover, the site plan
organisation of the church influenced Kahn in his later project of the Assembly Building
in the arrangement of the complex in a manner of a ‘citadel.’ By positioning the
Assembly block in the centre surrounded by a lake that would diagonally reach east
and west to the two banks of hostels, Kahn attempted to build a ‘citadel’ which he later
sought to fortify with a low pyramidical wall bordering the perimeter of the complex that
was never executed (fig. 176). Vale investigates the similarities between the National

Assembly Building and Phillips Exeter Library in New Hampshire (fig. 177-178). Vale
specifies how both buildings looked like fortresses, how the interiors are focussed on
height and how the exteriors are punched with primary shapes to encourage a play of
light and shadow (fig. 179).616 Vale criticises, commenting, ‘for an architect so
concerned with discovering the essence of each institution, the resultant designs of
these two places are curiously similar.’617

The initial elevations of the Assembly Building resembled the Unitarian Church
through the blank colonnades with shadowed windows and lightwells above the
central chamber (fig. 180-181). The idea of lightwells was criticised by the PWD as
they claimed them to diminish the religious aspects. As a solution, Kahn then reduced
the height of the lightwells which caused him to eliminate the idea of a Rochester-like
two-walled system elevation which was a climate-friendly solution for bright sunlight
and tropical rains. Instead, Kahn designed the offices with a glass elevation to provide
transparency placing them behind a concrete wall, carved with cut-outs of geometric
shapes. Placing the courtyard in between these carved two-layered concrete walls
permitted the sharp sun of Bengal to enter softly in the offices during the day. The
double-wall system also shared a similar aesthetical advantage to Corbusier’s brise
soleil.618 As Kahn finalised his design of elevation with carved-out geometric shapes
in a double-wall system, this not only created a vertical emphasis with marble banding
but also reflected a modern version of Mughal double-arches with stacked porches
(fig. 182-183).

Kahn had many concepts and ideologies to develop through his architecture but he
was stranded with similar forms in terms of how to express them. The expression of
these forms not only evolved from Kahn’s ‘private vocabulary’ but also from the choice
of materials he preferred despite the ease of availability.619

5.3.3 Religion and Legislature
Kahn’s initial inspiration for separating the two citadels of the Capitol Complex came
from the intention that one was to be spiritual and the other secular. This was
apparently, according to Kahn, to symbolise the duality of man’s physical and
metaphysical nature.620 Kahn’s idea of creating a ‘transcendence of assembly’ was
contradictory to what was mandated in the Constitution of 1962. Kahn’s search for a
capitol design was a manifestation of spirituality rather than a house of legislation.621
According to Kahn,
A house of legislation is a religious place. No matter how much
rogue you are as a legislator, when you enter the assembly,
there is something transcendent about your view.622
The Chief Architect of the PWD between 1965 and 1982, namely Abul Bashar,
described the National Assembly as a space in which politicians would be discouraged
to tell lies as the building would be surrounded by the Supreme Court (judgement in
the world) and the Mosque (judgement by Allah thereafter).623 In the formulation of
anti-colonial nationalisms, Chattarjee introduced the concept of there being two types
of social institutions – ‘material’ and ‘spiritual.’624 The indigenous approach of any
practice serves under the ‘spiritual’ listing, in which nationalism can be used as a
political disclaimer with the opposition group (discussed in Chapter 2).625 In contrast,
Vale argues that Kahn’s attempt to separate the sacred and the secular was

uncompromising despite knowing the country was breaking up due to religious and
cultural issues.626 Nevertheless, Kahn faced challenges when he attempted to
translate his ideas into the architectural drawings.

In the initial masterplan of the Citadel of Assembly, Kahn designed a huge pyramidicalshaped mosque with traditional minarets in four corners (fig. 166). The mosque was
an interpretation of how Kahn perceived the Islamic culture of the region. He wrote,
I was inspired by the devotion of the Muslims to their prayers five
times a day and was struck by the anonymity of the mosque.
There was no preaching, one simply said prayers. Yet it was a
community building, used by all, without any direction.627
Kahn’s first attempt to create an enormous mosque, as Vale has criticised,
‘overreacted to the role of Islam,’ ‘underestimated the forces of monsoon,’ and perhaps
misjudged the monumentality of the Assembly Building placed beside it.628
Furthermore, the role of Islam in relation to East Pakistan was never clear as the social
and cultural issues were given similar priority as the religion. Additionally, Kahn, who
was raised in a country which separates church and state as well being born as a
member of a religious minority, seemed reluctant to notice the sensitive issues which
East Pakistan was facing. Therefore, the challenge was to assess if the nation needed
a mosque or a place of worship. Even though the majority in East Pakistan and most
of the officials were (and still are) Muslim, the region also embraced other religions.
Therefore, the PWD thought that a large religious structure might convey an

impression that the Pakistani government was dominated by religious belief more than
democracy. The mosque’s entrance was also a matter of debate for a long time, as
Kahn wanted a space open to the public in contrast to the PWD who suggested the
access should be only for the officials of the assembly. Komendant highlights how a
great deal of controversy arose when Kahn faced the meetings with the Pakistani
authorities to discuss the Islamic features, the mosque and the orientation of the
building.629 Despite Kahn being adamant in his design decisions, for this requirement
Ahmad and the PWD prevailed. Finally, the solution was to design a meditation space
accessible to all religious groups who would be using it; indeed even atheists could do
so. The final discussion ended with dramatic irony in which the PWD and Kahn
agreeing that the meditation space ‘could be oriented toward Mecca but should not
look like a typical mosque.’630

As a solution, in May 1963, Kahn made some major changes to his second design of
the masterplan.631 At first Kahn changed the orientation of the central chamber and
lake to include the mosque into the body of the main building (fig. 167). As the
Assembly Building was already aligned with the north-south axis, Kahn decided to
rotate the curvilinear corner shafts of the prayer hall slightly off-axis towards the Qibla
(angular to the west) (fig. 177).632 Architecturally, this off-axis solution was a visible
break from the massive symmetry of the primary building. Although the slight angular
inflection of the prayer hall was a relatively minor visual interval compared to the

orthogonal Assembly Building, nevertheless, Kahn handled the shift by creating a
‘strong axial symmetry in the adjacent ablution block that revealed a skewed view into
the prayer hall beyond.’633 Kahn stated in his lecture at the Berkeley:
See, the mosque turns slightly towards the west. I purposely did
that, I purposely put this building there like that so I could turn
the mosque the other way.634
Kahn needed to take a number of rational decisions about the institution which might
have been overshadowed by his ‘contemplative spiritual nature.’635 During the design
of the whole complex in Dhaka, Kahn’s words and actions were contradictory,
something which was evident in the placement of the Supreme Court and in the
ideological specification of the prayer hall. And even though the assessment or
solution was in favour of the worships of all religions, the space was ultimately
designated to be designed for Muslims. The space remains as a prayer hall for
Muslims to this date (fig. 184).

In relation to the orientation of the prayer hall towards Mecca, several architects in
Bangladesh produced discourses which have consequently been explored in the
scholarly writing of Vale, Wiseman, Goldhagen and Ali. Some claimed that the prayer
hall was misoriented considering it a local embarrassment which also violated the
principles of mosque design. Yet the allegations were only based on assumptions.
Vale notes, ‘Whereas Mecca is located slightly south of due to west from Dhaka, it

does seem plausible that the orientation of the qibla wall of the protruding mosque
entrance would look to the visitor to be pointing to the northwest.’636 This perception
is also evident in the plans of the National Assembly Building. After examining the
angular shifts, it was clear that because of the orthogonal features of the South Plaza,
the entrance of the prayer hall was not oriented cardinally but rather was faced slightly
in a southeast direction (fig. 185).637 Thus Kahn himself did not make any error here,
instead it was perhaps the other people who were concerned about how the designer
interpreted the role of Islam.

Although Kahn could not achieve the ‘gathering of a community’ through his prayer
hall as it was highly restricted, nonetheless, he was successful in composing a
‘dichotomous space’ which he implied by positioning the prayer hall adjacent to the
Assembly Building.638 This composition worked well in expressing the different
functions of the two institutions by interlocking them side by side. Over the course of
the design process, Kahn shifted and modified the mosque or prayer hall as it was one
of the main functions requested by the authorities. The initial adoption of a pyramidalshaped mosque sharply contradicted the diamond-shaped form of the assembly.
Nonetheless, the final composition resulted in an interlocking block with rotated axis
towards Mecca (fig. 177). The tilted shift in the two-dimensional drawings for the prayer
hall reveal Kahn’s intention of creating the aforementioned ‘dichotomous space’
between the prayer hall and the assembly building. This ‘dichotomous space’ with two

functions of the offices and the laboratories. See, Goldhagen, Louis Kahn’s Situated Modernism, 193.

5.3.4 Regional and Climatic Perplexities
Kahn is largely praised for accommodating local climatic solutions in the design of the
National Assembly Building. Kahn’s writings illustrated that he was deeply concerned
about Dhaka’s harsh tropical climate and attempted to design the complex in
consideration of the scorching sun, seasonal monsoon and flood. Kahn wrote, ‘I visited
the land again in the height of monsoon, and I realised how thorough the hardship is
during those time when almost half the land is inundated.’639 However, many of these
endeavours were misguided as Vale has argued it is not only that Kahn designed in
accordance with Dhaka’s climate and failed, but also, that he was so extremely
involved that it resulted in an enormous social and financial burden.640 In relation to
responding to the climate, three elements of the National Assembly Building are worth
examining: firstly, the artificial lake; secondly, the elevation treatment; and thirdly, the
material choice and its implication.

The artificial lake surrounding the Assembly Building on an elevated platform and the
low areas of the land were to be filled with earth dug up from the lake which was
conceived as a ‘giant basin’ to control seasonal flooding (fig. 186).641 Kahn used water
as an important symbol to reflect the significance of boat transportation via rivers in
East Pakistan.642 Initially, the PWD objected to the idea of placing a waterbody
surrounding the main building as it might also resemble the frequent flood occurrences
in Bengal. But Kahn argued that the waterbody in fact resembled the concepts as
featured in Mughal mausoleums where this could be a very appropriate solution as a
drainage system during the heavy monsoon season.643 However, for a country which
suffers annual floods during the monsoon, one rising capitol building surrounded by
reflecting pools was not a climatic solution rather an aesthetic one. The masterplan
organisation of the Mughal monuments is evident in this arrangement in which Kahn

designed the ‘citadel’ surrounded by a pool of water which could dissolve the ‘concrete
and marble edifice into endless shimmering reflections.’644 At first, this was not
convincing to the client and the idea was interrupted. However, there was always a
matter of security and the suggestion of limited access from the PWD. Thus, the idea
of having a separate Assembly Building surrounded by an artificial lake was ultimately
accepted, with, as Reed recalls, the waterbody ‘guarding its spectacular vistas.’645

Figure 189: Play of shade and shadow in the interior. Source: Louis I. Kahn Collection, University of
Pennsylvania

The deep facades were designed to be a barrier from the sun and rain (fig. 187).
However, whilst it created a poetic play of shade and shadow in the interior of the
building, it did not provide much natural light inside (fig. 189). As a result, and in a
similar vein to the Five Polytechnic Institutes, the National Assembly Building was also
a victim of modern architectural orthodoxies and remained too dark requiring artificial
illuminations (Discussed in Chapter 3). Furthermore, too busy considering the sun and
338



rain, Kahn consequently neglected issues of wind and humidity.646 Kahn’s long-time
friend and associate Anne Tyng claimed that the double walls of the National
Assembly Building were built to prevent the country’s extreme heat, however, they in
fact provided an insufficient cross-ventilation in comparison to the air conditioning
system which was installed after the construction.647 The building is air-conditioned
throughout and it costs almost two million dollars per annum to maintain the machines.
Ultimately, the outer wall could not act as a shield for the sun and rain nor could the
inner wall provide a façade to support the high energy consumption within the building.
Kahn defended his decision by stating, ‘it costs money to fight the sun,’ however, David
Wisdom, one of Kahn’s associates, noted that he successfully persuaded the client
and committee to allow these extravagant designs to happen.648 In order to achieve
either aesthetic, functional, climatic or monumental consideration, Kahn was always
persuasive with his logic and he never unattached himself from his ‘spiritual mission’
which is mostly evident in his prayer hall design.

In the early stages of the design Kahn wanted all the buildings of the Capitol Complex
to be constructed of reinforced concrete including the Assembly Building. Vale
disputes that Kahn’s decision of using concrete demonstrated a strong symbolism that
synthesised with the Assembly Building.649 However, reinforced concrete was not as
available as brick in Dhaka. Thus, it was decided that only the National Assembly
Building would be built with reinforced concrete and the hostels would be constructed

with brick (fig. 188).650 In the end, aesthetically, the overall composition of the building
delivered an honesty achieved through Kahn’s approach to the handling of materials.
The reinforced concrete inlaid with white marble bands recalled the material
organisation of Mughal structures. Although the application of reinforced concrete
demonstrated Kahn’s version of modernism in the East, nonetheless, due to Dhaka’s
monsoon climate, the exterior of the building consequently suffered from greenishblack mould periodically. The reinforced concrete was blackened by tropical fungi and
needed annual cleaning with hand brushes. As a result, the walls were overwhelmed
by stained water, revealing an uninhabited porches which were ‘a mere gesture to the
exigencies of climate.’651 Kahn may have been working on a water proofing solution
for the elevations, but eventually it failed to protect the surface from dampness.652
Even today, the government still spends a substantial amount of expense in order to
clean the moulds off the walls.

5.4 Politics and Transformation of the Nation
The construction of the National Assembly Building commenced on October 6, 1964.
The construction mainly began because Kahn’s office was under pressure by the PWD
as Khan was planning his first visit to the site. As the construction continued, the cold
war between the two wings of Pakistan evolved into a civil war when Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman announced liberation and independence in his historic speech on 7 March

650 Kahn acknowledged, ‘I got into doing brick because I could not use any other material. So I had to
use it. It was self-protection to use brick in [Dhaka]. I knew concrete would be a complete failure. But
still my love for concrete couldn’t be denied, so I tried to make these people a purse, let’s say, out of a
sow’s ear.’ See, Wurman, What Will Be Has Always Been : the Words of Louis I. Kahn, 51.

1971. American citizens were evacuated from Dhaka. Consequently, Kahn’s office
was shut down, his contract was terminated, and the construction of his grand Capitol
Complex was paused. In assessing the rapid transition in the construction history of
the National Assembly Building, it proves very complicated to analyse the structure
from multidisciplinary perspectives. Hirst notes, ‘Buildings do not readily narrate. But
siege warfare needed to place soldiers and civilians within symbols, not merely to write
or speak about buildings in war, but to symbolise what mattered through the building
themselves.’653 Here was a building that underwent numerous alterations both in
design and construction, suffered a cold war and a civil war and its creator’s death
alongside famine and flood in Bengal with a martial law in place; it must surely narrate
one of the most complex and interwoven architectural histories in relation to its broader
purpose. The purpose that started from the sceptic Constitution of 1962, continued in
an unstable newly independent nation of Bangladesh and ended as a symbol of its
democracy. The relationship between democracy and the National Assembly Building
is intertwined not only with its political context but also with its architect. Considering
these issues, this segment will analyse the creation of the National Assembly Building
in two sections: firstly, with regards to the broader intention of the Pakistani
Government; secondly, in relation to the transformed ambition of the Bangladeshi
Government. In both sections, the architecture will be studied within the dogma of its
context and the people involved: the architect/s, the client, the new client, the final
design and construction; and the repercussion of the Liberation War.

5.4.1 Dualism in Democracy
The Constitution of 1962 assigned Islamabad and Dhaka as the first and second
capitals of Pakistan respectively. Islamabad was chosen as the first capital because
its location was convenient for the armed forces. Although the 1962 Constitution stated
a return to a democratic system after several years of martial law, nonetheless, a
military base was vital for the Pakistani Government to ensure a political and economic
hegemony of West over East.654 Notwithstanding that agitation from the East Pakistan
was flaming, and the creation of a second capital can be perceived as a ‘gesture of
appeasement.’655

Dhaka as a second capital was meant to be more of provincial, whereas Islamabad
was an entirely new creation intended as the principal seat of the Pakistan Central
Government. Although in his speech to introduce the 1962 Constitution, Khan
proclaimed that the source of law should be the National Assembly, nevertheless, the
political system also approved that the ultimate power of justice would solely be in the
hands of the President.656 Apparently, nine Bengali leaders later issued a complaint
against the new constitution as the assigned electors from the assemblies were not
given any power to decide anything and everything was to be by the agreement of the
President.657 In addition to the complaints, Bengali politicians were not treated equally
to West Pakistani politicians. There were 150 seats allocated to both wings on the
basis of equality despite East Pakistan had a larger population than West Pakistan. In

1967, West Pakistanis were outnumbered by East Pakistanis by 50.8 million to 42.9
million.658 Furthermore, sixty of the seventy-five East Pakistani members of the
National Assembly opposed the 1962 Constitution.659 Unfortunately, none of these
allegations were taken into account and East Pakistanis could not rely on a provincial
National Assembly that mandated only as an election stunt.

According to Mushtaq Ahmad, ‘Ayub’s main aim was to provide a constitutional façade
for a dictatorial design.’660 In relation to this, Vale argues that Kahn may have also
provided an architectural equivalent to Khan’s goal.661 In contrast, according to
Muzharul Islam, ‘Kahn had no time or interest for politics. I tapped him once and found
him totally uninterested.’662 Nonetheless, Kahn made his designs ‘with strong political
assumptions and implications.’663 Although Kahn claimed that he was designing an
‘architecture of connection,’ he nevertheless, knowing or unknowingly, contributed to
the creation of a radical space within a social conjecture which had misconnections
within the concepts and designs.664 From the beginning, Kahn’s focus was to achieve
monumentality, however, if another architect had been in his place, he/she might have
evaluated the political perplexities and refused to treat the institution as a

monument.665 The role of Kahn’s concepts such as the ‘Citadel of Assembly’ and
‘Citadel of Institutions’ was fading away, which had once held a stronger
synchronisation with the initial designs.666 Kahn’s idiom of creating a complex of
transcendent nature was focussed on two citadels in which the interrelation between
these two zones was paradoxical not only for the symbolic meaning but also as to how
the programme was placed into the masterplan.667 The Supreme Court was never
realised as a part of the Citadel of Assembly and for the latter citadel, apart from the
Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital and the National Archives and
Library, no other structures were designed and constructed till the twenty-first
century.668

Throughout the ten years of designing the Capitol Complex on the basis of strong
ideas, poetic concepts and antique senses, Kahn always needed to validate his
juxtapositions which kept changing over time.669 According to his colleagues who were
associated with this commission, mentioned that Kahn understood the need for the
changes in the complex and was willing to modify those with clients’ demands.670 In
contrast to Kahn’s understanding of the numerous design changes, this ‘did not

668 Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College was designed by Louis I. Kahn. It was originally named as
Ayub Central Hospital. After the Sher-e-Banglanagar masterplan was initially progressing, Muzharul
Islam designed the National Archives and Library.
669 When Kahn was asked about his masterplan, he stated, ‘Does it have all the ingredients? If only
one is lacking, it will disintegrate. This is my problem.’ See, Tyng, Beginnings: Louis I. Kahn’s

prevent him from remaining equally dogmatic’ at the same time.671 As much as he was
keen to work on the alterations, Kahn was always adamant to emphasise his
‘architecture of connection’ that sometimes could seem to be incongruous. To an
extent, Kahn did his task, not to build a functional institution for the country, rather he
aimed to build a holistic space which could be placed anywhere.672 It seems
contradictory that Kahn used his architectural knowledge to monumentalise
‘democracy’ through the National Assembly Building whereas its client unequivocally
represented dominance.

5.4.2 A New Nation
Colossal commissions similar to the Capitol Complex have been connected with
political issues, but in this case, ‘the epic struggle’ was to construct a complex which
unfolded a parallel between the ‘political fortunes of Pakistan and Bangladesh.’673 The
riveting part remains on the issue of ‘national identity’ as the complex begun as a
second capitol of East Pakistan but emerged as the national icon for the independent
state of Bangladesh. There are many examples of buildings, erected when a new
government has emerged following a revolution that collocate the current regime. In
the case of Dhaka capitol, as Vale disputes, ‘architecture and its symbolism are never
so closely wed as to prohibit divorce and eventual remarriage.’674 In fact, the National
Assembly Building was conceived and groomed in Pakistan to symbolise the unity of
the two wings, but it was completed after the Liberation War in Bangladesh. This shift

in authority complicates the position of the National Assembly Building in the discourse
of architecture and politics as its purpose of being united with Islamabad was annulled
and the objective was redirected for sovereignty.

This project could remain incomplete as the client was no longer there. However, after
the war, the status of the Capitol Complex was elevated from becoming a second
capitol to the primary seat of government.675 Islam, still an activist of the victorious
party, convinced the new administration that work on the complex should continue,
and Kahn should be contacted.676 In August 1972, Kahn was indeed contacted by the
new Government of Bangladesh and in the beginning of 1973, he returned to Dhaka
with a more suitable modified masterplan for the new nation. The new plans included
more expansion and additional structures which were never built. Kahn died in March
1974 and the construction for the project was resumed in 1975 by the military regime
of Bangladesh. The remaining unfinished buildings alongside the completion of the
National Assembly Building were supervised by his long-time colleague David
Wisdom, Henry Wilcots who was working in Karachi for an American firm and Reyhan
Tansal Larimer, who joined Kahn’s office as an intern.677

Even though there were limited budgets and resources, the new government assumed
that completion of the building nevertheless viewed as the new nation’s
accomplishment.678 As a consequence, the project had extended periods of delays

and financial costs increased. The construction techniques were changed such as
mosaic application instead of marbles and wood frames for the windows being
replaced by aluminium frames.679 Nonetheless, the success lay in the completion of
the building which was according to Kahn’s original intentions for the design. If the
whole completion of the complex not taken place after Kahn’s death, there might have
been altered meaning for the central structure such as the symbolic shift from West
Pakistani authority to a relatively new Bangladeshi Government which yet needed to
be stabilised.680 However, Kahn was aware of the cultural differences of the two wings,
and his grand design might be seen as a repercussion of the political restructuring for
a new nation. Kahn wrote,
I toured the land and saw what happened during time of war.
They are very different people. They hold the state first, religion
second. What held East and West together was supposedly the
religious agreement, but when the East was freed from the West,
they considered the country first.681
Thus, the symbolic impact of the National Assembly Building was clear after the
independence. Bangladesh faced preliminary instability in the beginning as there were
subsequent government crises alongside the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman. Afterwards, a referendum was held for either continuing the parliamentary
system based on the British model or changing into a presidential system. A voting
system was introduced in which the ballot was printed with a NO for people who
opposed the parliamentary system and there was no space for YES, instead an image
of the Assembly Building was used to vote ‘yes.’ Architect Sanaul Haque, who was

present at that time during the vote stated, ‘Democracy would not have survived
without that building.’682 The National Assembly Building eventually became such an
important icon for Bangladesh that Kahn’s citadel was and still is printed on the
nation’s currency (fig. 190).

The fact that Kahn refused to work according to Khan’s preference for Islamic
architectural features, such as including a dome or an arch, eliminate the contradiction
that might have occurred after the emergence of Bangladesh. Thus, the transition was
easier due to the lack of specific symbolisations that could have reflected and implied
the regime of Ayub Khan or West Pakistani dominance. After the independence of
Bangladesh, the ‘citadel’ was renamed from Ayub Nagar to Sher-e-Bangla Nagar (City
of the Bengal Tiger), after one of the Bengali nationalist leaders, A. K. Fazlul Haque.
The purpose of renaming the place was to assign a role in the memory of freedom
fighters and this change initiated other gradual and subdued transitions of the building
that ensured its place as the symbol of Bangladesh.683 Following Islamic identity

(associated with Pakistan) or Bengali identity (associated with West Bengal), the
Bangladeshi identity is a product of independence. Developing a nation’s ideals by
amalgamating its past identities with such large-scale building is understandable. In
the end, architecturally or historically, as Vale notes, ‘the difficulties associated with
this Capitol Complex are tied more closely to Louis Kahn than to Ayub Khan.’684

Kahn had the opportunity to design an institution, which he believed can empower to
create other institutions.685 Therefore, Kahn acted on his belief that an architect should
be a social activist and ‘the client’s wishes were important only insofar as they
concorded with the architect’s ideal.’686 Kahn was aware of Khan’s authoritarian
practices which he overlooked to focus on his client’s stated goal of ‘creating a new
democracy.’687 Kahn noted, ‘This is a new capitol in a new country. […] It must be
indicative of a new way of life.’688 Kahn was so deeply involved in the project, that even
during the nine month long Liberation War, he continued to work on the Capitol
Complex. Indeed, Kahn was asked by his son, Nathaniel Kahn, why he was still
working on the project when there is an ongoing war. He replied, ‘there will be a time
that the war will be over and the people will really need this building more than ever.’689
Eventually Kahn not only succeeded in completing his design for the Assembly
Building but he also worked extensively on the masterplan of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar,

which is in fact still in the phase of construction to this date, almost 49 years after his
death.

Kahn’s search for creating ‘ruins wrapped around buildings’ might be another reason
that the building survived during the war.690 One anecdote in relation to this has been
cited in numerous sources with diverse interpretations. During the Liberation War, the
incomplete structure of the National Assembly Building served as an ammunition
depot for the freedom fighters and allied Indian troops. As much as it sounds
apocryphal, it has been suggested that the building escaped air attacks as the
geometric openings punctuating the exterior walls already appeared to resemble a
ruin-like structure.691 Wilcots stated:
The pilots making the runs over [Dhaka] saw this building and
they thought that it had already been bombed, because there
were so many holes in it, so they wouldn’t waste another bomb
on it!692
Kahn’s urge to design thousand-year-old structure, as Vale notes, became an
obsession to seek the connection between construction and ruin.693 If the anecdote
mentioned above is in fact true, then Kahn’s attempt of achieving ‘transcendence’ from
the concept of ruins succeeded to save his creation from the violence emerging from
the civil war. ‘Whether or not the Assembly Building was designed to be [a] ruin,’ as
Vale argues, the time span of more than twenty years for completion of the building

occurred with series of incidents: Khan’s political strategy, the Liberation War, the
change of client from East Pakistan to Bangladesh, the death of Kahn and the
subsequent political instability of Bangladesh. Despite all these occurrences, the
National Assembly Building was formed and materialised in accordance with Kahn’s
vocabulary of ‘what the building wants to be,’ seemingly relevant with the result and
how the building has been received in the present day.

Despite being such a celebrated design, there was always going to be controversies
about the final outcome of the complex. Some of Kahn’s colleagues and the PWD
were not happy with his behaviour during the design and construction process as he
would always be adamant to incorporate his conceptions and there were plenty of
delays to deliver the drawings. Wilcots mentions that Kahn’s reaction was rebellious
when the local engineers protested against his decision of inserting steel reinforced
rods into brick elements, as the area was not prone to earthquakes.694 Abdul Wazid,
an engineer of the PWD, recalled that they often had to call Kahn and remind him
about the pressure from the government. Wazid stated, ‘I went to Kahn’s office with a
$50,000 cheque in my pocket and told him that it was his if he finished the drawings.
After two weeks, the situation remained unchanged.’695 Komendant comments,
The parliament building, first so perfectly conceived, but fails in
design. The arrangement of elements is accidental and they do
not relate to each other in form or function […] May be artists
and critics will consider it great art and architecture. I don’t,

because these types of building do not talk to me or stand the
test of reason.696
These remarks from the people who worked closely on the project seem to reflect over
some of the issues separating the building’s visual aesthetics from its construction
flaws. For example, the central chamber is undeniably grand in its appearance,
however, there are acoustical problems. Additionally, there was long struggle over the
structure of the roof system. In the initial plans of May 1964, PWD criticised the top of
the building for resembling smokestacks and suggested that a dome would be better
to achieve ‘Islamicness.’697 As a consequence, the final design was a parabolic
reinforced concrete ‘umbrella’ engineered by Palmbaum for the central chamber and
an octagonal drum of twenty-five feet was built to produce a lightwell through the roof
(fig. 191, 193).698 Furthermore, little or no consideration was given for expansion
despite Kahn and his later predecessors who supervised the project, knowing about
the rapid population growth and the potential increased demand of political party
members to sit in the assembly (fig. 192).

Despite all the criticism about the flaws and myths, one aspect has remained constant
for the National Assembly Building, which is its ‘visual dominance’; with its massive
scale, positioning on an elevated plinth and material usage of grey-coloured reinforced
concrete that highlights the building is prominent in contrast to the surrounding hostels
built with red bricks. The building’s ‘aesthetic of authenticity’ comes to a climax as the
edifice ‘forces the viewer to reflect on the nature of the institution [it] faces, and on her
role and place within it.’699 An octagonal building, with simple geometrical forms
applied with careful repetition, is uniquely composed, as Goldhagen describes it, as
‘giant child’s set of building blocks.’700 The massive walls of concrete perforated with
primary shapes, generate monumental openings which resemble a vacant building
‘ready to be appropriated for anyone who approaches it’ through the universality it
offers.701 In both the massiveness and facade compositions, the National Assembly
Building achieved Kahn’s primary vision of being monumental and also became a
primary landmark for Bangladesh similar to the pyramids of Giza or the Pantheon in
Rome.

5.5 Conclusion
There is little or no doubt that most of the design and construction development was
a result of Kahn’s various tropes of ideologies and concepts. However, President
Khan, the PWD and state officials also played important roles in the instruction of the
drawings, programme briefings and other information required for the complex and

these were filtered through Kahn’s philosophies.702 Kahn’s approach towards his
design evolved with time and was shaped by the changing identity of the nation.
However, Kahn implemented his own ideas in such a way that Bangladesh (or
previously Pakistan) would not fully escape from the integration of those concepts.
Nonetheless, the National Assembly Building is neither an imposition of Western
conceptions nor a complete authentication of local traditions. It is possible to connect
this building with any other tradition or urbanism, but it became a symbol of
Bangladesh. However, the inspiration of designing the complex was not derived from
Bangladesh.703 Rather the building reveals national identity intertwined with its
architect’s attempt of ‘transcending the timebound parochialism of political conflict’ into
a universal institution.704

In the discussion of national identity, Kahn’s choices of creation might seem
ambiguous as the design of National Assembly Building neither conveys a notion of
nation-building or a union of East and West Pakistan.705 Kahn may or may not have
thought about nation building, however, through the cross-cultural disciplines which
developed the background to his influences and via geopolitical contexts, this chapter
revises the creation of the National Assembly Building through people, places and
events reaching beyond the materialistic relation between client, creator and the
product. This approach is crucial to validate not only the role of a Western architect in

a project of nation-building but it also problematises the idea of defining a monumental
building as a national icon or landmark.

The National Assembly Building is one of those examples of architecture which cannot
be evaluated instantly. Whilst its dominant features awe the spectators, the core
judgement will always be a war between its creator’s philosophies and its clients’
ambiguities. Vale inquires, ‘What sense does it make to try to single out qualities that
are exclusively architectural when the architect himself professed to be so concerned
with the meaning of institution?’706 Were the challenges Kahn faced greater than the
challenges the region faced by shifting its identity from Pakistan to Bangladesh? As
James Dunnett asked, ‘Could any delegates be good enough, heroic enough, for the
building? Will architecture belie the mundane business of the Assembly?’707

Kahn’s attempt to regenerate a sacred assembly of transcendent nature might seem
a privileged bureaucratic building inaccessible to the public, however, the deeper
meaning of this structure is in the representation of its timelessness and universality.
The latter is compacted within the volumetric expression organised by different
functions such as the office blocks behind the geometric punctured motif, the
Presidential Square to the north with parted sheer walls, the Southern Plaza with
cylinder shaped towers tilted to the Qibla to form the prayer hall, an oval shaped
member’s lounge to the east and a cafeteria situated within the interplay of light and
shadow formed by the circle cut in the concrete wall to the west. Finally, the four sides

of the building frame the umbrella shaped light shafts illuminating the central assembly
chamber. The connection between the external and internal spaces reflects a
balanced attitude to design. Goldhagen suggests that the National Assembly Building
contradicts Robert Venturi’s concept of a ‘decorated shed,’ recalling rather the
concepts of early modern or high Victorian Gothic architecture.708 Either Kahn was
capitalising on the Pakistani authority with his concepts, or it was a product shifted
from the symbol of unity to sovereignty. Ultimately, through its dynamic and threedimensional tension between rigidness and expressiveness, the building was
designed in such a manner that it could be a functional capitol for any other country
despite being set against a vast backdrop of social and political dilemmas.

Undeniably, today it is a building that is literally and figuratively an image of
Bangladeshi democracy. But the universality of this building creates such a
timelessness that it can be expressed any way a critic or a spectator wants to explain
it. Nevertheless, evaluating Kahn’s concepts from the beginning till his death and
despite the misjudgement that occurred through the construction, one thing is
deliberately constant which are the democratic consequences. The building might be
debatable on the basis of its uniqueness, however, because this building was built in
Dhaka, a growing resemblance of democracy is evident through the city’s urban
growth surrounding the National Assembly Building alongside its own architectural
features. This includes the everyday usage of the central chamber by the Government
of Bangladesh, a religious harmony that makes the mosque a meditation space, a city
that grew centring the building and lastly the gathering of citizens from outside of the

peripheries at the Manik Mia Avenue overlooking the Southern Plaza providing a

Chapter 6: Conclusion
The general insights produced by the thesis follow two key concepts – nationalism and
architecture which gradually unfold the interrelated issues of political and cultural
phenomena during the period between 1947 and 1971 – after the creation of Pakistan
and before the independence of Bangladesh. The aim of the thesis is to comprehend
the architectural production of East Pakistan through the transforming layers of
nationalism related to economic and political agenda, and cultural and religious
conundrums. This is demonstrated by studying the critical approach of historians and
architectural historians, personal ideas and philosophies of the politicians and the
architects, economic data, political constitutions and existing architectural drawings
and photographs.

This thesis is comprised of six chapters in which each chapter attempts to frame the
key themes of the research – the altered meaning of nationalism, gradual
transformation in architectural expression and the continuous religious-cultural
perplexities amidst the local and global state of affairs – politics and funding. The
framework of this thesis is shaped by these elements and by intertwining them with
each other the significance of the architecture of East Pakistan can be comprehended.

Chapter 2 elaborately discusses these themes both theoretically and rhetorically which
is vital to understand the further key findings of the next three data chapters. Divided
into three sections, the first section of Chapter 2 provides following insights – the
critical understanding of the concept of nationalism and nation-building, the

359



transformation from Islamic to Bengali to Bangladeshi nationalism and its different
interpretations, and how these changes in ideology played a significant role in the
postcolonial development of a nation. The second section is a brief comprehension of
Modern, Postmodern, Regional and Tropical architecture which is achieved through a
theoretical approach of architectural historians with examples of various architectural
projects. This study allows to explore architectural production of other postcolonial
countries as well as provide genealogical specifications of the case studies for the
next three data chapters of the thesis. Furthermore, through the study, the
architectural discourse of East Pakistan is comprehended by connecting with
previously discussed concepts of nationalism and nation-building. The third and last
section focuses on ‘search for identity’ through the paradoxical concern of culture and
religion. This section attempts to understand the ambiguities of being Bengali and
Muslim by recalling the historical and ethnic transformation through various rulers and
political changes in the region. The analysis allows to identify the identity crisis and
how it defines the altered meaning of nationalism at different periods of time. This also
provide an opportunity to interpret the case studies from different perspectives and
engage with critical dialogues of ideological and historical disputes.

Another key concern is the global and local political setting involving funding and
development schemes which are informed as the backdrop with relevant references
in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 in order to discuss how these buildings were commissioned
and constructed. Each of the chapters discusses the political setting for specific case
studies, the architect(s) involved and the engagement between the Pakistani
Government and the funding initiated by various organisations from the USA. Although

360



the political historiography remains generic throughout the chapters, nevertheless,
separate building commissions or the arrival of an architect or architects narrate
different circumstances and reflect changing political situations.

In Chapter 3, I investigate the gradual architectural transition between the modern
Islamic architectural practice and buildings designed by Muzharul Islam which started
simultaneously during the same period starting from 1947. The chapter then proceeds
to broadly analyse the architectural designs of Islam up until 1971. Alongside a clear
manifestation of architectural transformation between the designs of Hicks and
McConnel, Thariani and Muzharul Islam, the chapter also frames the contextual
background and the dilemma of Bengali identity which depicts the complex transition
from Islamic nationalism to Bengali nationalism. Although Islam was working in the
C&B under McConnel, nevertheless, his first two designs for the Fine Arts Institute
and the Public Library reflected his own personal political agenda. Islam was not only
an architect but also an active member of the left-wing league known as the National
Awami Party (NAP). Islam participated in discussions for sovereignty with influential
key figures namely Kalim Sharafi (singer), Shamsur Rahman (poet), Zainul Abedin
(artist) and Qumrul Hassan (artist).709 As Islam continued his architectural designs, he
deliberately introduced a notion of ‘Bengaliness’ through the ambience that
surrounded the buildings. A core argument in this chapter investigates if Islam’s
architecture was either ‘Regional’ or whether it played a significant role in nation
building. In an interview conducted between Islam and Nurur Khan, Islam recalls his
immediate concerns after returning from Oregon when he started his architectural

361



practice, ‘I deeply thought [about] what needs to be done. What my country needs now
is sensitive and rational architecture.’710 Khan emphasises that introducing
Regionalism was easier in the given context, but ‘region’ had a very different meaning
for Islam. ‘Region’ was perceived in diverse layers of socio-economic, tradition,
heritage, political and cultural-based aspects by Islam and each of the layers played
an important role in the expression of his architecture. Furthermore, Islam understood
the political division between the two halves of Pakistan very well. Islam realised that
modernism would develop the country and provide economic advancement. Western
influence is evident in Islam’s design due to his academic background; however, he
brought his knowledge from the West as a fruitful solution that contributed to the
nation-building of Bangladesh. At most what he did in his architectural practice was
the groundwork to establish modernism in the country.

Whilst Chapters 3 and 5 broadly focus on one architect – Islam and Kahn respectively,
Chapter 4 covers a wide range of architectural projects designed by various expatriate
architects. This chapter investigates multiple works of various architects interpreting
the diverse dimensions of their architectural approaches in a context foreign to them.
All of the projects the expatriate architects were assigned to work in East Pakistan
were related to the development schemes initiated and commissioned by Ayub Khan.
Therefore, this chapter covers a vast study of the relationship between Pakistan and
the US alongside the ample international funding provided for the projects. The core
argument of this chapter explores if these architectural endeavours can be considered

710 Nurur Khan stresses that if you need to understand Islam’s architecture, you first need to know
who he was as a person. Muzharul Islam repeatedly identified himself as a Bengali and expressed his
patriotism on various occasions. This quote was recalled by Khan during an interview conducted for
this research. Khan, interview.

either as the nationalist products for Bangladesh or as the products of Khan’s strong
vision of establishing an Islamic country of Pakistan. However, by analysing the
buildings designed by Doxiadis, Dunham, Rudolph, Boughey and Vrooman,
something very different from what Khan envisioned as religious nation-building is
revealed. Most of the designs were contextual and well-functioned for the climate. It is
undeniable that there are indeed profound references to Western influences in their
architecture and at times some were unaware of Islamic customs during the design
process (such as Doxiadis’ housing design which was criticised by Tigerman).
However, most of these buildings were built with proper climate consideration and
some of them are still functioning in the present day. Both Doxiadis and Rudolph spent
very little time in East Pakistan and their interpretation of architecture remains largely
in the format of climatic considerations. However, Dunham, Boughey and Vrooman
who spent longer time in the region, attempted to amalgamate their Western
knowledge with historical and cultural aspects of Bengal. These architects were also
working amidst regular political strikes and protests that occurred in Dhaka which
heavily interrupted the continuity of their jobs. Despite the argument that their
architectural endeavours might be according to Khan’s vision of Islamic nation
building, it is evident that the architectural community they built for and the buildings
that were produced during the political upheaval reflected a new identity as well as
providing new scope of initiating architecture as an institution and profession.

Chapter 5 presents the climax to the thesis in which I explore the architectural
historiography of the National Assembly Building of Bangladesh. I attempt to
investigate the relationship between the client Ayub Khan and the architect Louis I.

Kahn by studying their motives, the history of commissioning the project, the
interruption of the construction during the Liberation War and the final completion of
the complex in an independent nation. The core argument remains here that the
Capitol Complex was conceived for Pakistan and became a national symbol for
Bangladesh. Furthermore, the argument continues to explore whether the
architectural design produced by Kahn was relevant to its context. In the conclusion
of Chapter 5, I provide a discussion of the significance of the universal characteristics
of the National Assembly Building. Contrary to the discourse of universalism, the
National Assembly Building represents an expression of being ‘in the right place.’711 It
means if the Capitol Complex was designed for any other nation, the outcome may
have been different and mainly for two strains – the mediator and the people. Firstly,
the design for the Second Capitol Complex of Pakistan was offered to Muzharul Islam
by the Pakistani Government. Had Islam in fact considered designing the complex,
then it would have never been commissioned to Kahn. Islam refused the offer to
design, however, he remained instrumental in bringing in a more suited replacement
for the project. When Indian architect Doshi visited the National Assembly Building, he
remarked that it was, ‘as if Islam was whispering in Kahn’s ears.’712 After the project
was commissioned to Kahn, Islam continued to be a mediator acquainting Kahn with
the culture of his country and consequently the influence and inspiration of traditional
values are evident in the design of the National Assembly Building and its surrounding
complexes. Secondly, the construction of the Capitol Complex was conducted by
Kahn himself and after his demise it was supervised by his colleagues David Wisdom

and Henry Wilcots. These expatriate figures supervised thousands of Bengali
labourers who were assigned to work on the construction of the edifice. Nurur Khan
argued ‘it is exactly designed for where it is supposed to be. The outcome would be
very different in another context, where would they find thousands of workers and
labourers to hand-build such a monument?’713 These construction workers carried
materials on their heads in baskets to the site and local bamboo scaffolding was a
main technique for the construction carried out by them. Thus, it would have been
impossible to complete the Capitol Complex of Bangladesh without the involvement of
its people.

In the history of East Pakistan between 1947 and 1971, there are two people who
played important roles in architectural advancement – Ayub Khan and Muzharul Islam.
As contradictory as it sounds the initiation of nation-building was a primary concern for
both, however, the two men were working parallelly according to two very different
layers of nationalism. By the time Khan came to power, Islamic nationalism had
somewhat transitioned into Ayub’s nationalism in which the US intervention was a
major support. Khan wanted the rapid development of colossal projects in order to
show US delegates that their funding was being used for the development of the
country. Khan also had a personal motive for East Pakistan’s rapid development in
that he wanted to appease the population and win votes during the election.

In contrast, Islam’s motive was to place his region on an international platform. This is
evident in his design of the Public Library which was featured as a modern building of

Pakistan in Koenigsberger’s article.714 Subsequently, Islam was constantly active in
bringing his foreign networks to work in the region such as Tigerman who completed
massive Five Polytechnic Institutes in collaboration with Islam, Rudolph who was
assigned to design AU by the World Bank and Kahn who was commissioned to design
the Capitol Complex. Islam recognised that international architects would not only
produce buildings but would also bring opportunities for learning design and
construction techniques first-hand for the country.

The final research questions for this thesis are threefold: can one posit these
architectural buildings as nationalist products for Bangladesh? How is nationalism
ultimately portrayed within these structures? Did the political context really shape the
design ideas? To answer these questions, firstly, consideration should be taken for
the context these buildings were built – a postcolonial setting; Pakistan freshly
appeared as a country on the global map and the gradual decline from its Eastern
counterpart ultimately led to political turbulences. Secondly, global politics should be
taken into account – the financial support of the US and sharing a border with
Pakistan’s antagonistic neighbouring country, India. Pakistan’s ambition to build a
nation led to a quick friendship with the US which was not coincidental, rather it was
an intelligent political understanding by both countries. The US wanted an ally country
closer to Russia during the 1960s Cold War situation in which Russia was actively
supporting India. Subsequently, Pakistan needed to achieve an economic balance in
order to have an equal position to India in the global perspective. In both cases, US
and Pakistan benefitted from each other for at least a decade.

Thirdly and finally, is understanding the key architects who were working in this
context. Each of the architects who worked in East Pakistan perceived architecture as
a ‘tool’ and contributed to the architectural production of the nation. I am not saying
the motive was strictly noble as the proper design and construction of buildings
ultimately also provided these architects with more opportunities for work.
Furthermore, if the meaning of architecture as a ‘tool’ for each architect is explored, it
would perhaps demonstrate different meanings. Islam notes,
The task of an architect is very difficult here. You have to make
it clear. On the one hand, we are plunged into confusion due to
[the] political and economic situation. On the other hand, we are
in a cultural conundrum where we have no image of ourselves
that will form the basis of our work. Here we have to struggle [on]
a number of fronts. One, there is [an] overall adverse social
situation. There is world-wide domination by Western culture.
Then there are various tentacles of that domination that make
the search for our roots an extremely difficult one.715
Islam perceived architecture as a nation-building task in which he understood global
capitalism, Bengal’s rich past and the struggling context of domination. Furthermore,
Dunham identified the void of local architects and stressed how structural engineers
provided designs for buildings which would not have survived due to a lack of
knowledge in constructional techniques.716 Kahn’s perception of architecture is

716 Dunham published articles as a professor of EPUET during his stay in Dhaka. Two of his
published articles were provided by Katherine Dunham. The first one entitled ‘Some Problems of
Architecture in Dacca’ briefly discusses the problem of not having local architects in the region and
the problems he faced as an expatriate. The second one entitled ‘Planning the School Building’ is an
article co-written with his wife Mary Frances Dunham. This article describes the difficulties they faced
due to having a lack of architectural equipment in order to teach pupils.

compelling in his own philosophies, however, for the Dhaka commission, Kahn’s
involvement was intriguing.717 It is evident that he continued to work on this project
from his Philadelphia office during the nine months of civil war despite knowing that
he might not be able to continue or that the client may be changed from Pakistani
Government to Bangladeshi Government.718 Eventually, all of the architects perceived
architecture sensibly and applied their knowledge to the production of buildings in East
Pakistan as a means of providing a good service to the land.

The independence of Bangladesh has an eminent history, however, what is less
recognised is the architectural historiography which was built amidst the social,
political and cultural phenomena. Furthermore, scholarship on the architecture of
Bangladesh between 1947 and 1971 is characterised by critical efforts to frame these
buildings within the canon of modernism or regionalism. This thesis attempts to
interpret the architectural production of pre-independent Bangladesh between 1947
and 1971 through its intrinsic and extrinsic meaning. The intrinsic translation is
revealed through the spatial reading of the forms, structures and materials and
extrinsic meanings are explored through the interrelation of history, society, politics,
economy and culture. The buildings demonstrated in this thesis are not only portrayed
as products of nationalism but it has also clarified how they were conceived in a
capitalist environment and transformed into architecture for national identity.

717 In Sundaram Tagore’s documentary, Carter Wiseman states that Kahn was so involved in the
project that he ultimately died during the design and construction development. See, Tagore, "Louis
Kahn’s Tiger City."
718 This is discussed elaborately in Chapter 5 under the sub-section entitled ‘A New Nation.’

The thesis provides a compelling discourse between nationalism and architecture of
the pre-independent Bangladesh between 1947 and 1971, nevertheless, there are a
number of limitations which are based on two factors – research data and research
scope. There are very limited resources available related to the topic, most of which
provide similar ideas and information. Many relevant architectural drawings archived
at the PWD and the National Archive were either destroyed or difficult to read.
Therefore, a sufficient amount of historical and architectural reading was possible
through multiple interviews and by cross-referencing the information with other
resources. Furthermore, during the Covid-19 pandemic, it was very difficult to travel,
therefore, I had to rely on data retrieved from online archival resources and email
exchanges and Zoom meetings with architects and architectural historians.

The research scope of this thesis can be combined with the broader historiography of
the postcolonial architecture of India and Pakistan. However, the purpose of this thesis
is to emphasise the study of Bangladeshi architecture. Therefore, I choose to remain
solely focused on the phenomena related to East Pakistan. Needless to say, the
historiography of postcolonial Pakistan plays an inevitable role in the study of this
thesis, however, the research intentionally circumvents deeper analysis of postcolonial
Indian nationalism and architectural historiography. There are related and relevant
references used in this research on the political events of West Bengal between the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries such as the Bengal Enlightenment, the Swadeshi
Movement and the study related to Bengali identity (Chapter 2). Furthermore, for the
architectural reading of the case studies, the study explores relevant buildings from
India designed by Charles Correa, B. V. Doshi, Achyut Kanvinde, Le Corbusier and

369



Louis I. Kahn (Chapters 2 and 3). Related architecture from West Pakistan is also
mentioned as some of the projects were simultaneously ongoing in East Pakistan as
well. These include Doxiadis’ design for the Rural Development Programme in
Peshawar and Comilla (Chapter 4) and the incomplete project of Capitol design in
Islamabad by Kahn which was later designed by Edward Durell Stone (Chapter 5).
Other studies related to India remain detached from the research because most of the
events require to explore Indian political historiography are either in relation to West
Pakistan or in relation to Bangladesh after independence. Therefore, this thesis
provides a scope to develop a new and broader investigation of architectural and
historiographic interest related to the Indian subcontinent and its contextual
background.

The thesis contributes to postcolonial and Bangladeshi scholarship in various ways. It
presents an original and primary architectural analysis of the selected governmental
and institutional buildings and provides a better comprehension of the development
and transformation of these projects through design and construction process. It also
explores and accounts for anomalies within global and local political interference as
well as continuities. This provides a richer understanding of the architecture of East
Pakistan signifying a valuable subject of architectural history.

The three themes explored in Chapter 3, 4 and 5 respectively allows broader
architectural concepts to be understood in new ways. Particularly, it provides a
nuanced and distinct comprehension of the architects’ effort to invest architecture into

370



nation-building. It also contributes to the understanding of an evolving new nation’s
path towards a modern movement and what comes after.

The thesis also contributes to the discussion of modern architecture in a non-Western
postcolonial setting. All of the projects analysed in this thesis have not been studied
from this perspective before, therefore, this dissertation plays a pivotal role in
expanding the architectural canon. Furthermore, this thesis directly engages and
intersects with multidisciplinary studies of history, politics and culture. From an
architectural perspective, Bangladesh is inevitably shaped by the ideologies of multilayered nationalism and paradigm that accompany the dichotomy of East and West
Pakistan. This thesis argues that the architectural project built between 1947 and 1971
are nurtured and developed in a nationalist environment and designed and
constructed from the ethos of twentieth century modernism. The thesis thus offers
unique insights into the beginning of Bangladeshi modernism and how it contributes
to the later decades of architectural production until the present day.

This thesis provides an opening for a distinct enquiry into the architectural realm of
Bangladesh in relation to its political backdrop. The buildings selected as case studies
represent a new beginning for architectural endeavours in Bangladesh. This
investigation includes a new layer to the multifaceted narratives of Bangladeshi
architectural historiography and will hopefully prove to be a valuable reference for
further study of the buildings after the independence.
